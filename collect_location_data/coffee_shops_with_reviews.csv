This lovely spot specializes in traditional Thai desserts, and every bite is a testament to their dedication to authentic flavors and beautiful presentation","Service is horrible. I arrived at a time when 2-3 staffs were busy at the back of the counter packing, but even if busy you should acknowledge and let the customer know to wait. Only when I tried to ask where to order, did they tell me to wait with an annoyed look. Very bad hospitality all around, no smiles or thank yous at any point.",The atmosphere is great with the nice traditional sweet.,"Anyone who doesn't like Thai desserts should try this shop and they'll change their mind. They're incredibly delicious, with a wonderful aroma of coconut milk and palm sugar. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced. The salted rice cakes, sugarcane syrup cakes, steamed rice cakes, and dog's tongue cakes – everything we ordered was delicious. It was a truly amazing experience. The shop is cute, comfortable, and has parking in front. I highly recommend trying it."

The food menu is limited to a handful of well prepared meals - I had chicken with chilli and Thai basil - delicious.
The iced chocolate is delicious, and tastes of real chocolate. Located in a townhouse complex it's a hidden gem and worth the effort to find.","The bigger original chain at Old City is closed (those that u saw in the pics). We dined at the smaller but charming outlet. Spend a total of 500THB and was given a complimentary tasting of the freshly hand poured single origin coffee beans from Nan. Lovely service staff.

Back in March-April 2025, we were very impressed with the flavor of their chocolate-infused bean. It was great!

Now, however, something has gone wrong with roasting process. The chocolate flavor is gone even though it's still marketed as such.

Without this additive flavor, their beans are average at best.","this clean, lrage-feeling shop primarily sells coffee machines  (and some coffees) , including high-end ones, some look quite commercial; if you need the best you should look here;

the cafe was lil bit far away from the city but trust me it was worth it. they have parking too. also, to worth your trip, there's a second hand thrift shop around there (like 2-3 places with like 10-20 baht per pieces) if you interested too!","Such a lovely and heartwarming cat café! 🐾 The place has adopted 14  cats, all super friendly and playful.

There’s no entrance fee – just order at least one drink per person, and you get to enjoy your time with the cats. Drinks are nice, the staff is kind, and the cats bring so much joy. Highly recommended for cat lovers or anyone who wants a peaceful, happy place to relax.","Again we found Cat Alley on Google reviews. The food was lovely and reasonably priced my husband thought the braised chicken was the best meal that he had, had throughout his whole time in Vietnam. The people spoke good English and we return ed 2 nights in a row. If your visiting Hoi Chi Minh I suggest visiting Cat Alley.","Cute place! The cats are super friendly and very playful. There are a lot of them, do check out the top floor as well!","The place is nice, but very bad attitude towards customers. Drink was good, but when you come with 4-5 kids, it’s overpriced.
In one hour we were asked to leave the place even we paid over 900 bats including drinks and food.
If to consider that generally we don’t have a crowd as our big family, we paid a good money for this unpleasant experience. unfortunately this bad treatment for your money is not delighted experience. Never come back and don’t recommend to anyone"

It’s a Melissa and Doug catalogue. I loved the different areas - quiet section for books, puzzle areas, role-play, and then the climbing, swings and ball pit. The staff were really engaged for tidying up and safety— very sweet to my daughter.

Finally, the washroom area with the little potty’s was so clean. We enjoyed going even on a Saturday.

Considering the nature of kids, I find both rules unreasonable. 3) Matcha latte gives me headache, that’s rare for a person who drinks a lot of matcha latte. All in all, a good place for kids but not a no-brainer for parents.","Very clean and thoughtful play cafe. Bonus points for children-size toilets, nurseling room, and change tables! Food was tasty - probably the best I’ve had at a children’s cafe. Lots of variety of play activities for the kids. Not the cheapest option but you get what you pay for. We will come back!"

Well made coffee and fresh ham & cheese bagel.

Attractive spirit house in the center of the parking lot.","While traveling through East Asia, we kept running into the same problem. The coffee just wasn’t doing it for us. We love coffee, and after tasting it all over the world, our expectations are high. Then, in Northern Thailand, everything changed.

We were driving through Chiang Mai with no real plan when we noticed a small sign that simply said “Solace.” Something about it caught our eye, so we pulled in without thinking too much about it. That turned out to be one of the best stops of our trip.

The second we walked into Solace Café, we felt it. Not just the smell of fresh coffee, but a calm that made you slow down without trying. The space was bright and open, with sunlight coming in and soft music playing. It felt peaceful, welcoming, and honestly like exactly where we needed to be at that moment.

My girlfriend and I have always bonded over coffee. Over the years, we’ve made it a thing to search for great coffee wherever we travel. It started with Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and after that first cup, we were hooked. Since then, every place we visit, we’re chasing that same feeling.

We’ve walked through coffee farms in Colombia, tasting beans roasted right there on the spot. Brazil surprised us with rich, chocolatey flavors that instantly made sense once you tasted them. Costa Rica gave us clean, bright cups grown high in the mountains. Italy taught us to appreciate a simple espresso done right. Turkey and Vietnam showed us completely different ways coffee can be enjoyed, and we loved that too.

Coffee, for us, isn’t just about caffeine. It’s tied to memories, places, and moments we’ll always remember.

Back at Solace, we took our time looking through the display. Freshly baked cakes, snacks, desserts, and fresh squeezed juices all looked incredible. You could tell nothing was rushed and everything was made with care.

I went with the blueberry cheesecake, and it was unreal. Smooth, creamy, not too heavy, with a buttery crust and just enough blueberry to balance it out. I paired it with a cappuccino, warm, rich, and comforting in the best way.

They also offer three coffee roasts, light, medium, and dark, so you can really choose what fits your mood.

We shared a Thai Harvest Energy Bar made with dried longan, toasted coconut, nuts, seeds, and a touch of honey. We also grabbed fresh squeezed juices and a ginger lemon shot, which was the perfect pick me up before heading back out into the city.

Some of the best travel moments happen when you don’t plan them. You just follow your instincts and see where you end up. Solace was one of those places for us, and it’s a stop we won’t forget.","The coffee is very delicious with excellent quality. It’s aromatic and has a well-balanced flavor.

The shop pays great attention to details, from the packaging to the ice.

Even though I ordered delivery, the quality was just as good as if I had eaten at the shop.

I recommend going to the shop because the atmosphere is great, and the service is excellent.","Drinks are good and staff is very friendly, though it is a bit pricey for matcha which understandable. Good for sitting and working since there are outlets available but it is too cold for me. Bring the sweater if you wanna sit and work there.",Perfect coffee.  You can choose the level of roast. Lovely staff. Soft music. Good atmosphere!

The staff was very friendly and the hostess spoke excellent English. She helped guide me through the menu and I brought home a delicious meal. She also mentioned that they would be happy to deliver to our house, so I took her up on it tonight. I had a wonderful Pad See Ew moo, broad noodles with vegetables and pork in a delicious sauce. My wife had the stirfry pork with garlic, and a side of white rice, and we split an order of kale with pork also served with white rice. She says the pork was very good and very garlicky, and she knows her pork. The kale was also very tasty, although we had hoped for morning glory, but they ran out. We definitely recommend this place, and plan on making it our regular neighborhood eatery.","Food was good but the service was dysfunctional. A very long wait for the food we ordered, even though they were not particularly busy. We had to remind them a number of times about outstanding food orders - no feedback provided, left totally in the dark as to what was going on! For example, the rice was delivered after all the other dishes had been served, and eaten! This is such a shame as this is clearly an exciting new venue in the area. My feeling is the establishment lacks any clear leadership. If they fix this, they will be destined for success, I'm sure. One positive, the musician/singer was excellent.","Love this place.

The play area kept our 3 year old entertained for a couple of hours, while the big leaved trees provided plenty of shade for our baby. The Koi Carp were equally entertaining for everyone. We went Monday early afternoon and it was very quite. We just had a couple of delicious smoothies.","Great place overall – very family-friendly and comfortable even with small kids.

Convenient location, not too far from the city.","The fried rice in pineapple and fried rice with pork was very good, not too oily and the salt content was perfect (very little). The size of the dish was on the small size considering the cost.
We also ordered khao soi with chicken. The soup, wet noodles, dry noodles were very good and plenty of flavour and hot spice 😋. The chicken that came with it was not as good, cooked correctly but then left to dry in a fridge, then reheated and put in, because the inside was dry and very difficult to break the meat away. I ended up taking it out and used my finger to hold it while taking a bite and then some soup.
The Mocha cold was very good, good mix of coffee and chocolate.","Amazing, big and quiet place in a nice, cool valley. We had lunch at the enclosed a/c room on the 2nd floor with great views.

You can tell how much love and effort Bee puts in every single cup of coffee he makes!
The experience of trying the cocoa fruit with coffee for the first time is a something I strong recommend to everyone!
I do not regret going there every single day I spent in Chiang Mai!!","We went to this shop a few times while staying nearby. B is an absolutely lovely man and a knowledgeable barista! We wanted to try the cacao pulp coffee but he didn't have any on hand, so he brought us to the trees in the back to find a fresh pod. Such a fun experience, and really good coffee!! Highly recommend the cacao shell coffee latte. The atmosphere was also great, such fun decor, and a super sweet pup named Coco. I'd for sure be a regular here if I lived in Chiang Mai. Thank you, B 🩷","This cozy cafe serves cocoa made from scratch using cocoa beans. The owner is very friendly, and he explained a lot of things. We ordered an ice cocoa, and it was incredible! It was my first time seeing a cocoa pod, which was also very exciting! Thank you very much for the wonderful experience!","Makes good quality coffee. Also tasted the fresh cocoa drink, it was so flavorful. The owner has his own plantation where he harvests the cocoa and fermented them himself. Bought dark chocolate from him which is 100% cocoa without any sugar or other additives. This also tastes quite good.","recently discovered this charming little café on a quiet street, and it’s a true hidden gem! The owner cultivates his own cocoa and roasts it himself, resulting in an exceptional hot chocolate. The same dedication goes into their coffee, which is of the highest quality. It’s a place that feels like a well-kept secret, and I highly recommend visiting.

The owner is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, providing lots of information. He can even speak English, which is great for international visitors. If you’re interested in learning more about cocoa, he even has fruits available for tasting.

As a chocolatier from Switzerland, I can confidently say that the hot cocoa here is outstanding. I would go back in a heartbeat and recommend it to everyone. Whether you prefer hot or iced chocolate, or top-notch coffee, this place has it all. Plus, there’s plenty of parking. It’s truly a wonderful spot that shouldn’t be missed!”"

I wanted something lighter than smoothie. I also did not want coffee drinks so I asked if she can sell coconut water only , not coconut smoothie. She asked sugar option, and I chose no sugar.

The café has limited seating, so big groups may find it a bit cramped, and sitting outdoors without ventilation can get warm. The menu isn’t extensive, but everything is made to order, not premade, so there’s a short wait — definitely worth it for the quality.

The café is run by a sweet lady, Teng, who adds a personal touch to the experience with her genuine smile.

The staff here are super friendly and welcoming. When I came in, there was this guy and a lady working, and honestly, they were both so nice
anything I asked for, they were happy to help.

I actually first came here right after I landed in Chiang Mai
it’s called Yodcha , and it’s inside a mall just by Chiang Mai Airport. A couple of days ago, I tried one of the best teas I’ve ever had in Chiang Mai. It was this lemon tea, super refreshing. My friend got a hot latte and an iced latte, and both were amazing.

They also have this local specialty called ‘Chiang Mai Bread’ it’s basically toast, but it’s so good. And the ice cream? Sweet, creamy, and honestly, I think it might have coconut milk in it… not sure, but it was incredible.

I usually order online. The tea is delicious. I recommend it to everyone I meet. When I arrived, I was very disappointed. Not with the tea, but with the staff.

- The customer stood at the counter and didn't pay attention. When I called to order tea, they looked upset and didn't say anything. Another person came to take my place. They were busy, standing in the wrong spot, or something. Could they just say, ""Wait a minute,"" or something?

- When I ordered, they were silent. They didn't accept cash, and they abruptly said, ""No cash accepted."" They looked at me like someone using cash had a problem, even though it was government-issued.

- When they called for tea, they didn't call my name. They just said green tea. Who knows whose cup it was? They put it all down at the same time. Then the staff complained, ""I want to get off work at 4:00, I want to go live my life.""

- I wonder if the shop is forcing the staff to work overtime. Why are the staff complaining and not being attentive?

- The atmosphere is bad. The shop is hot. They're not as friendly as the staff.

I won't recommend this place to anyone again. It's a shame the tea is so good and fragrant.","The atmosphere is great, the shop is nice and comfortable.
It's located inside the Go Wholesale mall.
There's hardly any crowding.

They have a wide variety of teas to choose from.
And there are promotions where you can buy a drink together or bring your own cup for a 5 baht discount, but these promotions can't be combined.

The tea taste is average.
The orange tea was a bit too sour (maybe because I ordered it less sweet).
The matcha latte was okay.
But I really liked the atmosphere and the cup design that doesn't require a straw."

I informed the waiter that we do not eat chicken and requested a vegetarian replacement. Unfortunately, instead of preparing a fresh dish, the same plate appeared to be returned with the chicken removed. Small pieces of chicken were still present in the meal. This raised concerns about food handling standards and attention to dietary requirements. While mistakes can happen, the response to the issue was disappointing. Other than that, the atmosphere was nice and less busy than downstairs. Food selection was good too and the staff members were friendly enough.","Located just at the entry to the checkpoint for international flights, nice place to sit around till the crowd clears and then clear the customs and security for your flight. Coffee and tea here are decent but nothing special. Decent place to get a drink to kill some time but that’s about it.","Black Canyon at Chiang Mai Airport (Domestic Outside) is a convenient and comfortable spot to grab a bite before your flight. Located near Gate 3, it’s perfect for a quick stop to enjoy a meal. The menu offers a great variety of food, and everything I tried was delicious. The dishes are flavorful, satisfying, and definitely worth the price – a great value for airport dining.

I felt really happy with my visit here. The food quality is excellent, and the service was friendly and efficient. It’s an ideal place to relax and refuel before your journey, whether you're traveling for business or leisure. If you're at Chiang Mai Airport and looking for a tasty, affordable meal, I highly recommend Black Canyon. It will definitely make your wait more enjoyable and your day more flavorful","Airport coffee.  Blackcanyon coffee means a good consistently tasty cup of coffee.  Service is professional. Typically, quick and easy.  Comfortable seating inside the airport with free WiFi.  There is only 1 dark roast offered.  There is ample supply of snacks and yummy sweet treats. Price is fair",I had a very unpleasant experience buying coffee at the airport. The Thai staff was impatient during ordering and spoke negatively about customers right in front of us. This was very unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable. I would not recommend buying coffee here.

Departure, arrival, or just waiting to pick someone up at odd hours is so much better now.

Where else could we have had pizza, subway, and bingsu all at once at 23.00?","Terrible cafe', DON'T waste your money here",Moved to second floor in domestic building.,"The reason I gave it a full score is because the price of the food has not been increased. The price is the same as other branches, but this branch has the same price. The taste is the same as other branches. There is no reduction in quantity or quality. Overall, the shop is quite spacious, there are few people, and there is Wi-Fi and plugs to use like other branches. The weather is a bit hot. I'm not sure why they don't turn on the air conditioning, but it's not a problem. You can sit comfortably. There are other shops together, but the smell isn't strong, so there's no problem. Overall, I like it because it's cheap. 555 //RYO","The staff should be replaced. The one who was in charge on July 10, 2018, at 6:00 PM was chatting loudly and even screaming in the lobby. I don't know if the branch owner knows this or not. The male staff member didn't seem welcoming and didn't smile at all. He just wanted to sell, collect money, play games, and play on his phone. #Looks like he's not mature enough to work in service.

The Baristro at Robinson Chiang Mai just opened and it’s already one of my favorite spots. The interior is modern and cozy, perfect for relaxing or working.

I had their signature iced coffee topped with whipped cream and espresso, beautifully layered and delicious. The menu also features great pastries and drinks.

If you’re nearby, definitely check it out. Stylish space, great coffee, and a chill vibe!","One think what i dont understand, why i can't add cheese creme.

And why isn't the cheese cream available for separate purchase? That's the only reason I come here. Now I have to buy two drinks and add the cream to my cappuccino myself. Please consider this. Offering the cream separately would make things much easier.","I enjoyed their hot chocolate with latte art and their tiramisu was really good too.

You are in a Airport so what can you do.
Anyway they have pastries and sandwiches and snacks.

Pro Tip: Also the chair in front of the store. Has plugs to plug in our phones.","The small outlet in the domestic departure hall is conveniently located opposite one of the security screening points. I ordered their scrambled eggs with bacon and for my wife the chicken sausage with fried eggs. Both menus came with coffe and the taste was very good, real eggs and tasty bacon and sausages. The coffe here is excellent as always, and the service is very good by the attentive staff.

The chef here is a trained pastry chef and it shows. Our genuine French friend said this is top tier stuff worthy of a real Parisian’s praise and he wasn’t lying. Chef’s kiss after each bite. The owner is sweet too: we ordered two croissants and they could only give one (these delicious morsels were nearly sold out) so she gave us her best selling sweet for the price of a croissant! This level of decadence isn’t cheap (70-150 Baht or so) but it is 100% worth it.,Delish Bakery. Lemon Meringue is the best I have had in Chiang Mai. The other deserts are good too.  Coffee was good but a bit strong for my taste; even in a latte.  Outside patio sitting had ash trays so smoking must be allowed outside :-(.

Personally did not feel like the coffee felt a bit too flat for a latte, so I would probably opt for a non-coffee drink or espresso next time.","The Arc Cafe in Chiang Mai is a spacious and visually appealing destination that caters to both food lovers and those seeking a beautiful backdrop for photos.

Ambience and Setting

Spaciousness the cafe is known for its ample space, but they have few comfortable seats few aren't if there are more than 10 couples you have to sit outside in the hot temperature

photogenic Corners: It boasts many corners designed for taking beautiful photos, including a swing seat. The overall design seems to lean towards a tropical style.

Atmosphere  a relaxed vibe
Food and Drink:
The cafe offers a variety of food options.

Pasta Carbonara The Pasta Carbonara is highlighted for its very creamy sauce.

Iced Latte The Iced Latte is praised for its strong coffee flavor and aroma.

Menu Variety Besides the mentioned items, the cafe also serves other beverages, baked goods, and potentially other dishes.

Additional Points from Online Sources:

Location: The cafe is located on the road along the railway, near Montfort College Secondary School.

Opening Hours: The cafe is open daily from morning until evening.

Features  both indoor and outdoor seating areas.

Surf Skate:  The Arc Cafe has a surf skate area.

Parking: Convenient parking is available.",Wonderful and very cute place. Now before Xmas the decoration looks lovely. Great place for work too.,"As a inline freestyle slider in Chiang Mai, I recommend this place. It’s big enough and the area is smooth. They also can do vegetarian egg fried rice without onion and garlic",Not too far from the railway station. Lots of parking space. Good place to get some coffee and some cake early afternoon.

The Krapao Platter is delicious. I've tried many dishes and they're all great. The portions are huge.

But today, I tried the Krapao Kai Omelet. It's a dish with Krapao and omelet inside. The omelet is fluffy and crispy, and delicious. I highly recommend it.

The shop is near Montfort School. You might have to make a U-turn to get here. If you don't want to make multiple U-turns, I recommend parking at Montfort and walking to get it. But there's parking in front of the shop.

Google reviews also say they have free fried chicken with jaew sauce. It's amazing!
It's so delicious and they give you a lot! 💕
They also have a promotion where you check in on Facebook and get 1 fried egg or 2 sausages. So many great promotions!

I got the papaya salad, and honestly, it was really good. The papaya was super finely chopped and had a real kick. BUT! I also had the pad thai with udon, thinking it would be like normal pad thai, but it was just swimming in this sweet sauce. It was actually pretty awful and the sauce just messed everything up. Then I ordered the panang curry , and the serving was tiny... I probably won't be heading back there... pretty average, really. Kimchi was fine.","This was the first restaurant we ate at after landing in Thailand and oh man, it set the bar high!!

The price range is reasonable, from 100฿ to 400฿ per dish, making it great value for the quality and experience.

The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and welcoming, making it an ideal spot for a family lunch or dinner. Whether you're dining with parents or bringing your kids along, the cozy setting ensures a delightful experience.

This review sounds natural, inviting, and informative. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!","We tried Kaffekeen after searching Google for food around our homestay. We had a couple favorites but wanted to expand our variety.
This was a good choice. We ate primarily Thai food, but they have plenty of other choices. But I personally didn't come to Thailand for western style food.
We ordered 3 dishes, which were
1) Grilled pork with chilli sauce 👍
2) Grilled pork curry 👍
3) shrimp curry with vegetables 👍

My favorite was #3 but it was close. The tastes had great flavor and richness without being overpowering. The sauce on the grilled pork was ""to die for"" yummy.

It's a newer place with a great ambience. Relaxing and quiet.

So ""Yes"" I will return for maybe a breakfast or lunch.

GIVE IT A TRY... you won't be disappointed.","During my stay in Chiang Mai, I generally came here for lunch and dinner, and also worked here throughout the day. The prices are quite affordable, and the cafe’s ambiance is wonderful. The only downside is the limited number of power outlets. By the way, I would recommend the ‘Spaghetti Carbonara’ for a meal.

Thanks ❤️"

The café is a bit far from the city center (around 5 km), but it’s absolutely worth the trip. The place is peaceful, charming, and surrounded by nature. At times, it felt like being in an Alice in Wonderland garden, with rabbits hopping around, ducks, and even pigs nearby.
There were very few people when we visited (day week around 4pm) which made the atmosphere even more special. It’s the perfect spot to disconnect, read, write, or simply relax, with the sound of the river flowing in the background.
The service was incredibly kind and attentive. We shared a two-tier basket of pastries with fruit. The portions are small, more like tasting samples, but the flavors were outstandin, delicate and absolutely delicious.

I forgot to ask for my cappuccino without sugar, and the staff was so kind that they prepared a new one for me without charging for the first cappuccino at all ❤. That gesture really stood out.

Overall, the place is beautiful, calm, and full of charm. I highly recommend visiting for the pastries and for a quiet, relaxing afternoon surrounded by nature.

I was absolutely amazed by the menu in Graph coffee - techniques used (cold brew jelly) and flavor combinations (coffee with tomato and lime) are unique. I've been to various specialty coffee places across Europe, never encountered anything like that.

This is a must try when you're in Baan Kang Wat, perfect place, located in the heart of the village, giving you the outlook on many craft shops.

Super friendly and helpful staff and a quick service. Would love to see more places experiment with coffee like that.

Firstly I enter the store and ask if I need to take off shoes and she just points to her shoes, with a blank expression.

There’s no changing room so you need to try items on top of your clothes, which we did respectfully. The whole time we are admiring clothes and giving them a go on top of our clothes- she continues being blunt and uninviting. The only time she speaks is after my friend puts the dress she tried on back on the rack,  she finally talks to us saying “ is that not good for you”. My friend politely responds they are nice but not as much on her body. She doesn’t respond or smile and we are left leaving that they just have a pay and go away attitude.

We end up buying hand made side bags (three of them) despite her acting like our presence was a burden. My friend grabs a pair of pants to try and she bluntly and in a tone says shoes off twice even though my friend hadn’t even began putting them on. Mind you, we are being so friendly with smiles despite these interactions trying to make up for the tense energy. After paying, my friend asks to use her cafe bathroom and she says no.

I don’t know what her problem is but you can communicate if something is wrong, we asked about shoes, tried over our clothes and admired everything without trying to disrupt anything. Although items are cute I could not endorse others to spend their money over other places that actually want to make potential customers feel welcome.","Feeling safe & satisfied of my staying here. Public area’s clean and free to use.
I love the lychi coffee very much.
And thanks to Pui’s treat!","I stayed at FINE HOMESTAY & FINE BREW for a month, solo and honestly, it felt more like staying at a relative’s beautifully designed home than a typical guesthouse.

First, the location is perfect. You’re a short stroll to 7-Eleven for midnight snacks, close to Baan Kang Wat for your artsy weekend wandering, and surrounded by solid cafes. A personal favorite was mo.cha Coffee, open seven days a week, always quiet, and ideal for getting serious work done without the background buzz of a hundred digital nomads on calls.

The space itself is spotless and full of character. You can tell Pui, the owner, really put heart and soul into the details, there are little design touches and cute corners everywhere that make it feel like a real home, not just a sterile rental.

What sets this place apart is that it isn’t just a homestay. There’s an on-site cafe brewing genuinely good coffee (not the “just okay” you settle for at many places), and they also sell handcrafted Thai crochet pieces, jewelry, and dresses (mostly for the ladies, but fun to browse).

Pui, the host, is a gem. She’s extremely hospitable, often offering you freshly brewed coffee, sharing fruit, or just sitting down for a good chat about life. You don’t get that kind of warmth in most places, it feels natural, not forced. Though there’s slight language barrier, her English is still conversational, just try to keep simple, slow and slightly louder.

Cleanliness and comfort were top-notch the whole time I was there. The vibe is quiet and relaxing, making it easy to focus if you’re working remotely or just want to unwind without constant noise.

A small heads-up: it’s not a big hotel with full-time staff or luxury facilities and that’s exactly why it works. You come here for the human touch, thoughtful design, and a sense of community (if you want it). If you’re looking for a cozy, home-like base with a great host and strong local flavor, this is it. I left feeling recharged, and a bit spoiled for my next stay anywhere else.","My first time in Chiang Mai and Fine Homestay & Pui gave me a warm welcome.
- Location is great, somewhat in more local & less tourist area. It is surrounded by nature, many great restaurants in walking distance. If you love the green, the nature, then this is the best location in Chiang Mai (after Fine Homestay, we tried other areas to experience and we realized that Fine Homestay's the best when it comes to being close to the nature). Get up early and take a walk around the neighborhood, it feels so greattt!.
- The room is super cozy and clean. Strong wifi for online working. Just feels like home. Just some noise at night as the house is on the street, but just put on the earplugs (provided by Pui) and you will be fine.
- Pui is a super host. She is caring, attentive, kind and so helpful. She gave us lots of recommendation for good restaurants. She also surprised us with tea and fresh fruits sometimes","We stayed at FINE Homestay for a month as a couple, and it was an absolutely delightful experience. The house is warm, welcoming, and incredibly comfortable – we slept so well every single night! The host, Pui, is truly one of a kind. She is sweet, caring, and always ready to help with anything you need. From offering great local tips to surprising us with fresh fruit as a welcome gift, she made sure our stay felt special and hassle-free.

If you’re looking for a cozy and relaxing place with a host who genuinely cares about her guests, we can’t recommend FINE Homestay enough. We’d happily stay here again!"

Ordered an iced white latte and was intrigued by the slow process of using a manual lever espresso machine. The taste however was rather mediocre to me but still loved the quietness of this cafe compared to the crowds inside",We picked this cafe for lunch as it was much quieter and more reasonably priced than others in the area. The thai basil rice and omelette was so tasty we went back for a banh mi and coffee as well. The staff were sweet to us explaining the different coffee and bringing us some cold water for free.

You can pickup self from order desk…","We ordered 2 chai tea. The wifi connection took very long time and it'svery slow.  Every Starbucks should have an easy & fast connection. Customers expect that. In the process of log-in, I had to provide passport number & phone number!  This is unacceptable. Also, the chai tea came on a plastic net!  It's the most unhealthy way to drink tea! Like I need more plastic in my body.  Here's a recommendation to the management, change the tea & log-in method & speed, or you will lose a lot of customers. In our 9 months in Thailand visiting numerous Starbucks, this is the worst Starbucks in Thailand so far.  You should set the standard, not lag at the bottom.","The service was disappointing. The staff member named Fai (the one who pregnant) was busy talking with another staff instead of focusing on customers. She asked me to scan to pay but didn’t create the QR payment because she was talking, which caused delays. My coffee also took longer than necessary for the same reason. I hope the service can be improved.",Love how this Starbucks isn’t too crowded in the morning. Perfect spot to get some work done! Bonus points for the friendly staff. 💘,"As of 2024, there were over 40,000 Starbucks coffee shops operating worldwide. Odds are, you have been to more than ten of them.

If you are looking for power outlets they are generally located on the floor or a nearby wall, not integrated into the table or seating.

Plenty of branded gifts on the right as you walk in. Sofas are located on the far left.

Unless you are sensitive to cold temperatures, you probably won’t need a sweater.

We literally make a special trip here every single morning just for their cappuccino; it’s that good. The quality is incredibly consistent: every cup is perfectly balanced, silky smooth, and made with real care.

The atmosphere is so cozy and welcoming that it has become our little morning ritual; starting the day here with a coffee feels like a proper treat. And as if the coffee wasn’t enough, their homemade natural ice cream is absolutely delicious.

Highly recommend!","Craving homemade ice cream? This place is a must-try! My favorite flavor was Yakult Pipo 😋light, creamy, not too sweet, and seriously addictive. 🤍🍦","A small place but bring a very solid game with coffee and bagels. The latte was perfect, not too bitter, a generous portion and at a super affordable price. The bagel was very good quality too, although a bit pricy for the portion.  The bagel and coffee stands are in the same shop but they take separate payments. All good and very pleasant atmosphere and service.","Roastiv is a great spot to start your morning with a good cup of coffee. They offer a variety of coffee options, along with delicious bagels from Volks, all in the same space. The staff is friendly, and there’s also outdoor seating if you prefer to enjoy your coffee outside. A solid choice for a relaxed breakfast or coffee break!",Came here based on google reviews when wife and I came to One Nimman for some shopping. Coffee was ok. nothing so extraordinary. I think it really depends on your taste. for me I like a mocha with a very rich cacao taste. this did not have the taste to my liking. the place is nice and service was good. not my favorite coffee.

It wasn’t bad at all—smooth, well balanced, and properly extracted. The atmosphere is relaxed and cozy, making it a nice place to take a short break from the heat and the busy streets. Good spot for a casual coffee stop.","Chilled atmosphere and nice staff.
The drinks are good and this location is easily walkable to the airport.","A great cafe. I like this place for the ambience. We'll designed. Good air-conditioning, friendly staff. Coffee prices are typical, not extraordinary. Ordered an iced Black coffee which is hard to screw up. Can't comment on the other drinks yet. WiFi seems good enough. Not overly crowded but a lively atmosphere in the late afternoon.","“Perfect for locals/residents and visitors (tourists or those who happen to be in this area).”  Those were my thoughts when I came here for coffee for the first time even though I had lived in Chiangmai for several years.

The Xym Café is modeled after Starbucks and for the most part they get it right, from the airconditioning to the light upbeat instrumental music to the incredibly luxurious comfy seats and spaciousness of the place to the availability of Cold Brew, Nitro, Drip, and other coffee options, to the sale of mugs and desserts.   But with an exception:  all of this available at a fraction of what you’d pay at Starbucks.  Oh, and they have plants with watering mists that keep the plants looking green.

Opens at 7am for you early birds who want to seize the day and get a head start on life.  There are also Chang and Singha beer options, just like any self-respecting Thai establishment. Heineken is represented too.
And local Thai snacks to accompany your coffee / beer or other beverage choices in this garden-like setting.  There’s the floral/plant motif that runs through this whole cafe.

Perfect all-around place to come solo, bring someone special, and just have some private time away from the bustle of the world.  This cafe has parking, and is located next to a 7-11 if you need to pick up a few items before/after your coffee.

Pro Tourist Tip:
The Xym Café is also located directly right across the “Old Chiangmai Cultural Center” (which has nightly food and cultural performances, depending on the season), so it’s great to be at Xym Café in the late afternoon and pop over to the Old Chiangmai Cultural Center in the evening for their activities.  The cultural center grounds is nice for a walk too, and there’s a famous Japanese restaurant within its vicinity, along with also a famous malt whiskey drinking place for aficionados.  There’s also the Ma Nee night market (which has a galore of food stalls) just a mere 2 minute stroll from the cafe.  So, all in all, this Café is perfect for an afternoon relaxing stopover before the evening activities just right across from it.

Kindly give me a thumbs up if you found this review helpful.  It encourages me to keep doing this.  Thanks.",Obsessed with this place!!!!!!! All I had in chiang mai was mingmitr coffe

The rooms were spacious, impeccably clean, and thoughtfully designed for comfort, and having a small kitchen was a great bonus for preparing snacks and quick meals. However, the best part of my stay was the incredible hospitality of the family running the guesthouse—they were always around, eager to connect, and truly went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. They took my friend and me to a cozy local coffee shop, helped me find a place to get a haircut, and made every effort to ensure we had an amazing experience. Their warmth and generosity turned my stay into something far more meaningful than just accommodation, and I left feeling like part of their extended family.

Then one random morning your brain whispers, not in Thai: tuna sandwich.

I’ve had plenty over the last couple of years, chasing that simple, salty, familiar bite like it’s a postcard from another life. And without a doubt, Poon Coffee & Restaurant (พูนคอฟฟี่) makes the best tuna sandwich in all of Chiang Mai.

It starts with the bread. Toasted just right, that sweet spot between sturdy and tender. Light butter. The kind of toast that makes a quiet crunch and then gets out of the way.

Then the tuna. Not a polite little smear. A real amount. Seasoned well, stacked between three slices of bread like someone decided you deserved a double-decker moment.

On the side: crisp lettuce, tomatoes, onions, plus a slice of watermelon and dragonfruit, like a small edible reminder that you’re not back home at all, and that’s kind of the point.

I washed it down with an Americano, the way I always do. Ice water alongside. A small cookie, because Thailand is generous like that.

“Heaven” is a big word, but breakfast like this earns it. If you’re in Chiang Mai and you get that sudden craving for something that tastes like memory, go see the good people at Poon Coffee & Restaurant. They’ll take care of you.

P.S. they have lots of Thai and Western food too!"

It’s peaceful yet welcoming and lots of people work here with their pets. No pet smell at all—there are multiple air purifiers throughout the shop.

There’s a nice selection of coffee beans; my iced latte (medium roast) was aromatic and smooth. The carrot cake wasn’t too sweet, which I loved.

They also have a meeting room (just ask the staff), plus plenty of seating: work desks, a second-floor counter bar, cozy couches, a four-seat corner and outdoor garden tables.","Coffee, Cuteness & Chill Vibes

My first time here. A cozy pet-friendly café just a 10-minute walk from Haan-Tueng Chiangmai, the Michelin-recommended spot. Run by two adorable “owners” — Teddy & friend 🐾 😆— usually napping like café mascots.

Coffee’s nice and reasonably priced, with a few homey bakes. Gets busy with teens and locals on holidays, so if prefer to a private and peaceful vibe - better avoid peak times.","Visited during the day and really cool place with dogs wandering around (the small one is cute . )Great work vibe with lots of powerpoints and fair prices. It does get busy, though, and seating feels limited. The outdoor space could be improved honestly it’s underused and lacks atmosphere. Still worth visiting.","A very cool Bistro with Workspace. Great Coffee and Cakes, friendly Staff and a great atmosphere. The 2 Dogs are also lovely.","It is cozy and quiet coffee shop with a calm, relaxing atmosphere. The two dogs are super friendly and adorable. They really make the place special. You can see they are even on the logo. The toilets are clean, and it’s a lovely spot to work or study inside, or to hang out with friends outdoors."

This spot is absolutely perfect for a working day. They completely tick all the boxes: convenient parking and a comfortable working area with great vibes.

Their many seating selection makes it incredibly comfortable while enjoying their excellent drinks and fresh bakeries.

Beyond the great space, the staff truly stands out. Their friendliness is the first thing you notice and instantly makes the place feel welcoming.

Considering the high quality and comfortable vibe, the prices are definitely affordable and offer great value. If you need a cozy and wallet-friendly place to chill or work with your laptop in Chiang Mai, you can't miss this one! 👍","A place worth visiting. The coffee is delicious and the people are very friendly. The gravel road at the entrance is a bit slippery, so other people coming here must be very careful. I fell down by accident lol But the owner of the store is very good and provided me with basic medical care. I am very grateful. Thai people are really nice. I love Thailand!","Consumer Advice.

The atmosphere, the staff and the drinks are good. I wanted to update my review as I feel I had been a bit too harsh in my previous review.

While the ice is a bit too much, I would recommend people to ask about the ice levels of their drinks first before ordering as it can be quite a lot. Really other than this there is nothing wrong with this cafe. Simply an issue of ice level.

This review is for others to consider before ordering their drinks.",A lovely place with great coffee and friendly staff. Huge carpark is a plus as well,"There are three sofa seats for more than three people in the store, while the others are double seats. The environment is very good, with many green plants. The waitress is also very friendly, but when we went yesterday, the coffee machine broke down and we didn't drink freshly ground coffee. It's a pity that the bread is very soft and delicious"

In fact I think the croissants are some of the best I've had in Chiang Mai. Extremely fresh and they do toast them which is really good. Owner is very nice as well I've spoken to him a few times and his English is very good. They don't have much of a restaurant menu so mostly what you can order is what you see in the front display.,"One of the best chilling cafe around here. There're many things that I'm fond of..

- Clean air : The smog in here is almost free (6-10) while outside is around 200. The temperature is just nice as well.
- Friendly with customers : They provided free pillows and blankets which are cleaned really well. You're free to nap, leaning, chating or whatever.
- Spacious, many type of tables, chairs, and sofa

The price is average. There's some discount on the cakes sometimes.

I'd suggest you give it a go if you want to chill around in the smoke-free cafe.

Updated : provided free printing","Great coffee spot with plenty of parking and ample space for anyone who needs to do work. Lots of comfortable chairs, including the big plush loveseats you see in tv shows.

Friendly Staff, Carpark in the front of the door","Very good coffee shop both for working or just hanging out, it has an incredibly comfy seating area with many different options: couches, comfy chairs, regular chairs, bar chairs etc. Part of the coffee shop is also colder so depending on preference you can choose what temperature you like. Very relaxing and cozy jazz music, super friendly staff. Tons of places to charge devices.

It was moist with the perfect amount of buttercream frosting. Our next favorite was the brookie. Get the milk ready cause it’s rich. Our third favorite was the scone. While it was super good tasting, it was very crumbly and I would dare say a little bit dry.

The pastries and cakes are very generously sized (basically like anything you’d find in the U.S.) and priced for Thailand - any other cafe would be selling their offerings for twice the price and certainly wouldn’t taste half as good.

As for the coffee — let’s just say the scenery ended up being the stronger part of the experience 😅","Very good location. Nice coffee shop. I had coffee with apple pie, it was tasteful. Friendly staff.","I NEVER take sugar in my coffee, but the girl who took my order thought I asked for some. It was too sweet and tasted bad. Hopefully, she learns to listen more carefully when taking orders.","This little corner coffee shop is absolutely one of our favorites in Chiang Mai!
The owner roasts her own coffee every day (which sometimes smells amazing) and grinds it fresh for every coffee drink.
They make some amazing lattes and cappuccinos, but also have a wide variety of other choices.
There is seating on the street level that is open, but if you prefer a quieter place to relax or work, there is a large, air conditioned room upstairs with couches and tables where you can sit and enjoy your time.
Free WiFi is available.
They have coffee and tea drinks, milk drinks, sodas, water, and smoothies, as well as really great danishes, croissants, and desserts. Ice cream is available, too.
Prices are really reasonable for the high quality.
We will keep recommending this little place to all of our friends!"

Nice break from the main streets!","Love the vibe of this place, very minimal interior and clean. Spacious enough to do some work, though a lot of the seating is not conducive to doing extensive laptop work.

Coffee was top notch. I got the Double Black which is 2 shots of espresso and orange. It was good if you like that sort of thing.

Shout out to the music curator, I loved the music. It was a soulful deep house kind of vibe. Exactly my cup of tea (or coffee rather 😉)","Solid matcha latte and excellent atmosphere!

Food is fresh, tasty, with some herbs hand-picked on the spot right before preparation, and gets ready swiftly. And the menu is very affordable.

The atmosphere is lovely, full (like, full!) of plants, on a not so busy street, with a home vibe whose only downside is the maker space next to it which 1 out of 3 times we've eaten here this far has had some loud noise.

The ladies who run this are so very kind. I can definitely feel the love they put into the food, and have come here almost daily during my stay.

I'd 1000% recommend it!","This is a hidden hole in the wall that we discovered the last day of our stay of 10 days! To increase the irony, we stayed at the hotel right next to it, but the tendency is to walk towards the action and main street... We wished we had discovered it before because this was by far the best meal and dishes we had in Thailand! Atmosphere is quiet surrounded by nature and the owner served us with grace. The food was literally spectacular. I wish Michelin would discover this place because the food is high quality and to the level of the highest quality restaurants with prices of any street food quality... Seriously you must try this place! Thank you so much for this last meal before our flight. The highlight of food of our 2 weeks in Thailand.","Excellent food in a really nice, relaxed atmosphere.

He then worked in various Michelin restaurants before opening his own in Chiangmai. The restaurant is cozy with very good ambience and service is very attentive and warm. The home made terrine is to die for whereas my favorite is the prawn risotto. It is one of the best risotto I have ever had and I highly recommend this dish. The chef is very friendly and will come out and greet you and discuss the dishes with you. Please do come here if you happens to be in Chiangmai. You won’t be disappointed.,"This restaurant is the best French restaurant I’ve ever been to. The food is amazing!!! I could not even manage to describe how I feel when I have the first bite of the beef, the juice like exploding in your mouth —— and you feel like you are in heaven, and I’m not exaggerating!
I’m not a gourmet, I took a long time thinking how to describe the taste? I just think the taste is very complex and complicated, but the magic is: everything is in perfect balance. All the ingredients are in good complementary relationships with each other, like the beef’s meat flavor with sweet and sour pomelo, the fragrance of salmon with fresh green vegetables… all I can say is amazing and could not find other words. No wonder it is made by a professional French chef with 20 years of experience.
My only question is: How come such a wonderful place with relatively little people found that? It should be known to the world haha!
Me and my husband would definitely come twice when we are in Chiang Mai again. You will definitely like here and this place is especially good for dating because the vibe is really romantic!","La Friandise in Chiang Mai is truly a hidden treasure that deserves every bit of attention. From the moment you arrive, you are warmly welcomed by an exceptionally friendly team that speaks several languages with ease – this instantly makes you feel comfortable and appreciated as a guest.

The cuisine is nothing short of outstanding. Each dish is presented with the finesse and creativity you would expect from star-level dining, combining exquisite flavors, perfect textures, and a clear passion for detail. It is rare to find such high culinary standards delivered so consistently, and every plate feels like a little work of art.

The atmosphere is just as impressive: a modern, stylish, and elegant interior design that creates the perfect setting for both a relaxed dinner or a special evening out. It strikes a great balance between sophistication and comfort, so you can fully enjoy your meal without feeling rushed or out of place.

Despite the top-class quality, the prices remain very fair and reasonable, making La Friandise an incredible value compared to many other fine-dining experiences. This combination of excellence and accessibility is what makes the restaurant such a standout.

All in all, La Friandise is not only highly recommended, but a true insider’s tip in Chiang Mai. If you love fine dining, welcoming service, and a modern yet cozy atmosphere, you should absolutely not miss this place.","Great hidden gem a bit outside the Old City walls. The restaurant is both: restaurant and coffee shop. It‘s run by a young French-Thai couple. He‘s the chef and she‘s the boss - taking care of everything else.

The restaurant‘s vibe is modern yet warm. They have a nice back yard with a few tables too. The menu is very small so they specialize on a few things and make those really well. I had the grilled mackerel. It was delicious! Value for money is good too. Will definitely be back.","My boyfriend and I just happen to pass by after our spa and went in for a treat! The chef and his wife also are the owners, and the staff are so welcoming and nice. I was looking through the reviews and wanted to order the lasagna, but it was not in the current menu.

We enjoyed every food we ordered, no complaints! The desserts were also amazing!  We savored every bite. Truly a french cuisine. We loved the food and the service. Funny thing is, this was our best meal in both Chiang Mai and Bangkok! (We did like some authentic Thai cuisine too but for our last day this experience took it up a notch).

The place is beautifully designed in a traditional Japanese teahouse style, with a calm and peaceful atmosphere. There’s also a lovely garden area outside, which must be even more beautiful during the day (we visited after dark).

The matcha selection is outstanding, with several grades and varieties to choose from. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and the presentation of the tea was elegant and authentic.

We enjoyed the experience so much that we even bought some matcha to take home. A truly serene and authentic spot - highly recommended for any tea lover visiting Chiang Mai.","Came in for a late dessert and was blown away by the quality of food and beverage, gorgeous tatami room, also the friendly service from the wait staff. By far the best place for Japanese style parfaits. The Yuzu parfait came with sorbet and yoghurt gelato, a perfectly balanced dessert with all the trimmings. The hojicha parfait came with hojicha gelato that's smokey, rich and decadent, perfectly paired with mochi and red beans. We also ordered sencha tea that came in the most beautiful artisan teapot, the best quality ceramic I've experienced in a tea house outside of Japan. The Japanese garden is simply zen and a delight. Definitely coming back for more!","Love the real Japanese vibe and the matcha taste was great! I ordered the usucha set with wagachi and loved it. Want to order the second one, but have to stop myself 'coz I still have a lot of matcha selection in my freezer 😊 If I lived in Chiangmai, I guess I would find myself come here quite often. Thank you for having this beautiful matcha house in the city center like this so, people can come here and experience peace! Hope your business will always do well.","Beautiful place with different areas to see. Extensive menu of matcha drinks. We took yamayuki. Interesting flavor, but personally felt too much wakame seaweed flavor. Matcha roll was perfectly smooth and not too sweet. Expect to wait in the queue to be sifted","Very disappointing experience for a place with so much potential. On a positive note, the Kokoro matcha was really good. Unfortunately, that was the highlight.

The service was poor, and communication with the waiter was difficult due to a language barrier. The place was extremely crowded, which completely took away the calm, quiet feeling you’d expect from a Japanese matcha tea house. It felt like they were trying to squeeze in as many people as possible, making it anything but relaxing.

We asked for a bit of extra milk, and only after checking our bill were we told we could get a small amount — just once. While we were still drinking our matcha, the waiter brought the bill, took our credit card, and didn’t return it. About 10 minutes after we could see the payment had gone through, we had to ask for our card back. This was uncomfortable, especially with how packed the place was and the card left unattended.

This place has all the elements to be something special, but unfortunately it fell short. It felt overpriced and underdelivered."

From the moment you arrive, the peaceful atmosphere and beautiful greenery invite you to slow down and enjoy the moment. The setting is calm and refreshing, with lovely views that make it perfect for a relaxed morning or afternoon.
The café itself is cozy and tastefully designed, offering comfortable indoor seating as well as outdoor spots to soak in the scenery. The food and drinks are thoughtfully prepared, with fresh flavors and beautifully presented dishes. The coffee is especially good—smooth, rich, and clearly made with care.
What truly makes Bella Goose Café special is its warm, welcoming feel. Friendly service, great food, and a serene location come together to create a place you’ll want to visit again. It’s a true hidden gem and well worth the stop. ☕🌿","After a delightful discovery experience at Bella Goose at the Pond, we had to check this one out and it was well worth it! Loved the genuine vibe, especially the original style café doors. The Beetroot Scramble was amazing and the PB Mocha was yummy. I couldn't resist the presentation of the Good Morning Smoothie Bowl, so we went back for it later. It was legit and did not disappoint!!","Food - Healthy & the taste just nice.

Service - Friendly helpful with lots of smiles.

Atmosphere - Clean, tidy, modern chill cafe.

Lots of choices in the menu, scratching head which to pick. Overall the drink & food is awesome.

Found this Bella Goose randomly & not regret to be here. Keep it up 💪🏼","Love this place! While in Chiang Mai for my trail race I ate here twice.

The first time was just before their closing time so it was practically empty. The second time was lunch time and most of the tables were full, but you can still find sitting outside.

The place is located on a corner of a busy intersection but once inside you can barely hear cars and motorcycles outside.

The waitresses are super nice and friendly. They pay attention to the customers and quickly respond if you need them.

You don’t have to wait long for your food to be served. Both times I had a coffee and a cinnamon roll. They are so good!

If I ever return to Chiang Mai I’ll definitely eat here again.","Bella Goose is one of those rare places that quietly becomes part of your routine—and then your memory. Tucked into Chiang Mai, it became my daily spot. A place where coffee isn’t just served, it’s respected.

The piccolo was flawless every time—silk-smooth, perfectly textured, carrying a bold, confident espresso that lingered just long enough. Their espresso stands among the best I’ve had in Thailand, and knowing they roast their own beans, sourced through real relationships with local farmers, makes each cup feel intentional.

Whoever is behind the bar is truly gifted—latte art is never guaranteed, yet here every piccolo arrives like a small painting. Consistency like that is rare. It’s craft.
And then there’s the food. The smoked salmon bagel is unforgettable—the kind of dish that follows you home in your thoughts. A beautifully made bagel, rich smoked salmon, a perfect schmear, all plated with care. Every plate tells you the same story: this team loves what they do.

But the heart of Bella Goose is its people. The kindest, warmest staff I encountered in Thailand—no contest. They go beyond service and straight into connection. I showed up every day, and somehow, it felt like coming home. That doesn’t happen by accident. That’s great leadership and genuine hospitality.

Bella Goose is a place to meet, to rest, to work, to linger. A place where time slows just enough for you to notice how good things can be. I couldn’t recommend it more."

If you order a black shaken iced tea with five sugar pumps, you’ll have sweet tea like you have in Texas. You can adjust accordingly to your taste. I don’t like mine super sweet so if you’d like it super sweet, maybe seven or eight pumps

it’s right across the street from the Marriott and right on the street with the night bizarre market

I hope this helps and I hope you enjoy your time in Thailand",Spacious little but plenty of tables starbucks. Great plates and beverages that i have not seen in other starbucks not even in Bangkok. Very clean and the coffees are made very well. It has all the great taste as it should be and its location is incredible.,"The staff here are polite, friendly, and helpful. The prices are standard for Starbucks in Thailand. My chai tea cost 95B. They also have a good selection of merchandise available, including the Christmas range.
The cafe is big with lots of seating available. They pull the blinds half down when it is too sunny 😊","Not a good representative of Starbucks - and I've been to hundreds of them in many countries. Not only does my starbucks card from Indonesia not work here (how is that possible?), they don't have a bathroom (astronomically rare), and the Starbucks internet wants you to register name, passport ?? etc. That's quite bizarre in itself, I go to a lot of cafe's out here in Thailand, I can't remember needing to give a bunch of personal details to use the wifi - data collection anyone?

Staff is very friendly and greets you with a smile. Coffee is very good. Go with the medium roast. Try their specialty drinks. I enjoyed a mojito espresso every morning.,"This was by far one of the best coffee I had. Medium roasted latte just masterful. It has a rich taste, very creamy texture and fruity notes. I took two bags of these beans to brew it myself!","The coffee was excellent. The service perfect. The only thing I would do here is refresh the interior. The trouble with the nearly all white interior is the maintenance needed to keep it looking good. It only really needs someone with a pot of white paint and an eye for decluttering and using the space better. There are some merchandising stands in the wrong place and the DJ kit could be designed into the space much better. The tiles you probably have to lay again. They are toast.
All this is forgiven because the coffee and the music are very nice.","Awesome coffee and dessert.
🏖️👍☕️🍵🍰🧁

Iced Americano, latte and cocoa all have a fruity aroma and a strong coffee flavor, which is delicious. The icy cheesecake is super delicious! The staff here are also very polite and the service is very good. 👍","The coffee was too good and of high quality. This was our go to place for morning coffee during our chiang mai stay.

I got the Iced Coconut Latte and cannot recommend it enough. The coffee flavor did not get diluted at all! I wish I had time to come back and get it again.,"Very cool coffee shop and cafe.

The coffee choices cover a wide range of serving styles and coffee beans that are roasted in house. Savor Society is serious about coffee! Be prepared to state the serving style, the temperature (hot or iced), and type of beans. Enjoy the high quality coffee.

The are nice food choices too. Many of the breakfast meals include freshly made bagels. The attractive selection of sweets will surely tempt you.

Have a seat and enjoy sitting in a shop that is thoughtfully and a bit eclectically decorated.

You’ll find this shop is well patronized morning, noon, and afternoon.  Join the friendly crowd and enjoy the Savor Society!

Feeling down and visiting the Bangkok Hospital? You can grab a coffee from the Savor Society location there!","So good! The latte (I selected Laos beans dark roast) is delicious, I could taste the unique notes. The cake is perfectly lightly sweetened and the fluffy cream balances the denser (but soft and moist) chocolate base.","Best coffee and best value in Chiang Mai.
The Basque Burnt  cheesecake is not too sweet just perfect with the coffee.👍👍😋😋","5/5 stars! We're so lucky to have this amazing coffee shop just around the corner from our place. The perfect spot to start our day with a great cup of coffee and delicious drinks. The service is top-notch, and the upstairs seating area is cozy and comfortable.

It is definitely not for the faint-hearted. This is my second time trying this out and not finishing again.

The props and experience was very thrilling and scary. The actors were awesome.

Check the prices and promotion first too.
You will also get 50% off their food and drink menu once you choose a package.

The location is very convenient, close to the heart of the city.

There are 4-5 games to experience lasting 60-90mins. There is 5 levels of scary with zero for the easily scared.

They also have pictures and videos for your memories at the end. =D","It's definitely the best escape room I've ever done. It is more of an experience where you follow a story than working out puzzles and clues. We didn't even do the scariest level, and my heart was racing the entire time. The staff were absolutely amazing and really put on a show. With student discount it's only 500baht and lasts over an hour, I'd highly recommend.","What an experience!!! Great service by all the staff. Great acting and support crew. I’m a bit of a softie when it comes to horror, so I’m happy I managed to finish. Definitely worth an hour or two of your time on a rainy Chiang Mai evening. Thanks guys! ขอบคุณครับ","One of the best and definitely scariest experience I had in Chiang Mai.

We had five levels of difficulty to choose and one scary experience.

I ordered the mocha-banana-frappe, my wife had a mocha-mint-frappe and my son had a hot latte.

All perfectly tasty and reasonably priced (THB180 in total). Limited seating but that’s part of the appeal.

My only gripe is they don’t accept Apple Pay - only a local banking QR code or cash.",Very cool little spot and Chiang Mai. Has indoor and outdoor seating with a tree growing through some of the sitting area. Servicewas very polite and everything was made from scratch grinding beans for every single order.,"Small cafe with a lovely vibe, fine coffee and delicious cakes. Plenty of different seating options although I liked the most the ones inside around a living tree that gives the place soothing atmosphere. Sometimes there are offered locally grown fruits in the basket next to the entrance for a bargain price.","Brilliant little coffee shop near Chang klan area. I’ve been coming here for nearly 15 years. Great coffee, fresh juices, smoothies and good little club sandwich if need a change from Thai food. Friendly happy faces, parking and good vibes. Small quaint place to stop and sit outside or inside. I love to come here when I go to my favourite massage shop Aree Thai massage near Anantara. Come down and support local business on Si Don Chai Rd just around corner from night bazaar…","Very cute cafe with good drinks. I tried the rose tea latte and my friend tried cocoa latte pearl (bubble was out so we replaced with pearl). Both were great. I liked the atmosphere of the shop - not a big place but plants were all around, felt cool even in a hot afternoon. Had place for parking."

The vibe is super chill, especially when you’re just sitting back with a couple of cold Singha beers. Watching the sunset from up there is gorgeous and easily the best part of the evening. Also, keep an eye out for the two resident cats; the ginger one is a total character and pretty cheeky!

The food was just okay for me, but you’re really coming here for the relaxed atmosphere rather than a gourmet meal. My only real gripe was the music, it was a bit loud for such a laid-back spot, so lowering the volume would be a huge plus. Definitely a solid choice for a low-key hangout.","Cool spot! Great coffee (and good value at only 60 baht for a latte!), cool retro vibe furniture, and stylish barista.

Opens early at 7am, has cute cats wandering around and a chill outdoor terrace right opposite the Shangri-La.

Trendy café by day, rooftop bar by night — what more do you need? This place is a hidden gem.","This place is a great hidden jem with lots of tasty appetizers that they make fresh in house. Unbeatable prices on local beers.

When it's not raining sitting upstairs is a very relaxing atmosphere and the staff are very hospitable.

We were here during slow season so it was not very busy at all yet the staff was still running around to make sure we were comfortable and having a good time.

They accept music requests aswell which is nice.

We mostly dealt with Posh (unsure of spelling of his name) and the other two employees Simba and Nala are pictured below.","Very nice roof top bar with friendly staff and surprisingly good food. The beer selection is the usual suspects + Asahi, which are reasonably priced (Chang is 88 bhat and the rest are only a little more).

Would highly recommend visiting if you want a chill location with some live DJs",Lovely little bar and coffee shop. We almost missed it and walked past as it is so well hidden. A little sign outside indicates that it is open and that they have a upstairs balcony. The balcony upstairs is very spacious and open with a lot of ambient lighting. Nice view of the Shangri la hotel opposite. The bar serves food as well as a variety of flavoured beers that are locally made in Thailand. Good place to have a chilled drink.

Hands down!!  Everything from decor, service, coffee selection, taste, smell, even temperature is a perfect 5star+ The coffee was brewed perfectly and the infused milk was NOTHING I’ve ever tried before. The rose/ orange/ whatever else they used were paired amazingly well with coffee. Who would have guessed.

The Transit Number 8 was good enough, but the Soft Latte was quite a fail because I felt that they didn’t use ice cream / soft serve but more likely whipped cream.

The price for a cup of coffee is little bit above the average cafes in Chiang Mai.

I didn’t go to their dining area, which was in a unique design (as many people reviews), but I very much liked their front store set-up and design. Really felt like I was in Japan.","First, they charge you 70bht/person at the entrance. Then you find out there's no empty seats on Sunday.

It also helps to know a bit of Thai, too, because Max and Kai tend to like to talk to you and get to know you better, especially if you live in the area.

Either way, I was not disappointed. I ate there twice during my few days in Chiang Mai. I’m 100% sure I’d have ended up back there again if not for being caught out by the 8pm closing time.

The decor was nice and their vibe was nice, chill and casual, perfect for a solo traveller. The staff were lovely friendly too.

For breakfast I had one of the set menu choices and on the same day, I went back for dinner and got their beef khao soi to takeaway. Unfortunately I got there close to closing time so I took it back to my hotel room to eat. It was SO unbelievably good!!

It was my first time ever trying khao soi so I have nothing to compare it to but wow, the flavours, the tender beef, the broth, the onions adding a extra zing, the portion size, everything about it was chefs kiss. And to think it only cost 100 baht.

If I’d had more time in Chiang Mai, I would’ve gone back to try the chicken khao soi as well as many other things on their menu. Yum.","This restaurant was a 30 minute walk from our hotel, but I feel it was worth it. It was one of the best Khao Soi I have had in Chiang Mai. Friendly staff, and a quaint clean atmosphere.

The Pad Thai was edible, but not very good. The flavor wasn't very intense (I'm not talking about spicy).

The place is cozy with Lego elements (there's also a display), although the name doesn't suggest it. The downside is that the staff doesn't clean the tables regularly, so you have to eat in an atmosphere of dirty tables.

The pad Thai was easily the best I've ever eaten. I have a whole new appreciation for what I considered to be an overrated dish.

The pineapple fried rice was so smokey with a subtle sweetness that we both loved.

The som tum with the fish was freakishly good. It paired so well together. Easily the best som tum I've tried in Thailand.

If you’re in Chiang Mai and craving something deliciously fresh, MilkLand is a must-visit! This cozy spot beautifully showcases the unique and strong partnership between Thailand and Denmark, where Danish dairy expertise meets Thai creativity. This relationship between the two nations goes beyond mere business; it’s a celebration of quality and innovation that has stood the test of time, and MilkLand is a shining example of this collaboration.

MilkLand specializes in smoothies, baked goods, and coffee-based drinks, each crafted with high-quality dairy that reflects Denmark's rich dairy tradition. Their yogurt smoothies, in particular, are a standout—perfectly balanced in tartness and sweetness, and ideal for a refreshing break on a warm Chiang Mai day. Their coffee drinks, made with creamy milk and paired with freshly baked treats, offer a delightful experience that’s both indulgent and energizing.

For those curious to experience Danish culture, MilkLand brings a taste of it right here to Thailand. And for anyone inspired to visit Denmark afterward, here’s a tip: maybe skip December! Winter in Denmark is very dark, with limited daylight, which can be a stark contrast to the vibrant, sunlit atmosphere here in Chiang Mai. Instead, enjoy the Danish influence at MilkLand in the warm Thai sunshine.

Whether you’re a dairy lover or simply in the mood for a delicious smoothie or coffee treat, MilkLand delivers quality and charm. It’s more than just a café; it’s a celebration of the strong, enduring connection between Denmark and Thailand. Highly recommended!",What the... why is milk so delicious...😳😳,Good place nice vibe,"😉 An after-school playground for Thai students

1. I went because I was curious about the milk flavors. They have a pretty good selection of drinks. I tried an iced mocha and it was pretty good.
2. There were a ton of Thai students. They seemed to be waiting for their after-school ride home. There wasn't a single seat.
3. When you order, they give you a buzzer, and your drink will be ready when you wait. It's popular with students, so there was a bit of a wait.","Excellent place where you can have a quality shake, milkshakes, chocolates. Dairy products. Super"

Moreover, every cats were skinny and they didn't have blankets or anything to keep the cats warm in a very very small, cold air-conditioned room. When I was there, the cats were seeking something to lay on and keep warm , so they just used every customers' bags. That was very depressive. The coffee was fine but wasn't worth a baht.

Sitting area and order area are separated, makes the sitting area more private. I love that!!

Variety choice of bread (Shio pan the most) MUST NOT MISS!! So delicious","Cute cafe in ChiangMai, variety type of bread. Buy from one place and bring to the sitting zone (self-service).","I recently visited ROUND N ROUND, and it was a great experience! The café has a chilled zone where you can comfortably enjoy salted breads. Their fresh bread, straight from the oven, is definitely a highlight—soft, warm, and delicious. The overall vibe is relaxing, making it a perfect spot to unwind. Plus, the café offers plenty of parking space, which is super convenient. If you’re looking for a place to enjoy fresh food in a cozy setting, this is a great choice!","The best place for Shio Pan in Chiang Mai offers an exceptional experience. The original shio pan is perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully soft on the inside. The venue provides ample parking space and comfortable seating, making it a great place to relax and enjoy delicious bread. I highly recommend trying the bread with their dipping sauce – it’s absolutely amazing!","Round n Round is a charming bakery that’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in Chiang Mai. The highlight here is the bread—freshly baked, with a wide variety of choices ranging from crusty loaves to soft, sweet pastries. Each item looks thoughtfully made, and the quality is impressive.

The shop atmosphere is cozy and homey, with warm wooden decor and a relaxed vibe that makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in. It’s clear that attention has been given to both the design and the customer experience.

There’s plenty of parking available, which is a big plus especially if you’re driving. However, one thing to note is that the dining area is located separately from the main selling area. While this setup helps keep the bakery space organized, it can feel slightly inconvenient if you’re hoping to enjoy your food on the spot without moving between areas.

Overall, Round n Round is a lovely place for quality baked goods, a calm atmosphere, and a nice little break from the city buzz. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys fresh bread and relaxing spaces."

It’s right next to Bangkok hospital so we ate here while visiting the hospital. We were very hungry and this place hit the spot.,"I came here with a coupon from Bangkok Hospital that is next door.
There is a list of choices for that, a few drinks and a few food selections.
I asked about tuna sandwich and was pointed to a display (see photo 1) with a good looking sandwich and selected that.
As I was eating in they didn’t want me to take pre-packed but serve it on a plate… and all I got was a half can of tuna between 2 tasteless slices of white bread without crust.  No lettuce, tomato, or mayo in sight. Bland and tasteless.
Even worse than any school or hospital cafeteria.
2 tables sent their food back while I was there.

Maybe this is acceptable if your mind is worried about a loved one in hospital and you don’t taste anything or don’t care - but otherwise I’d strongly advise against going here.","I wanted to like this place and the food, but unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. I ordered the Ribeye with Truffle sauce, cooked medium-rare. They seemed to focus too much on the truffle and not enough on the meat. When I first looked at it, I thought it was chopped meat; however, upon cutting into it, it turned out to be very dry and stringy. The truffle sauce was okay but nothing exceptional. The salad was fresh, and the potato was pretty standard. I also ordered the combo, which included the Thai Iced tea. It was better than what you'd get at 7, but not nearly as good as what Hand Brand offers.

Additionally, I had an iced Coffee from here in the morning, it was bitter and not very flavorful."

I rate this gym up there with the best I've experienced in Australia
Also it is kept very clean and tidy which is a credit to the management...thank you!","Me and my partner have been climbing for 11 years now, and we always make a point of going to local gyms whenever we travel.

Main wall is clean, relatively cool and well staffed. It is perfect for a visit once maybe twice during a holiday visit to CM.

Setting wise (Bouldering only!), it's definitely angled at the more intermediate climber which is understandable. My partner climbs ~6b/v4 and I climb ~7b+/v8/v9, and there was a lack of harder climbs there for me.

From what I could see there were no bouldering problems set for the two higher v grade colour tags, with ~5 blue tags at v5-6 which was a shame.

We both still had a good 2 hours climb however, and enjoyed our time there. If you are an advanced boulderer, it's a perfect gym for a good stretch and to hold onto some plastic for a bit, but don't expect a hard project session.","Very good climbing gym. I tried only bouldering, and although routes are mostly easy/intermediate (I found only one v7) they are still fun to climb. The only problem is that they don’t have AC so it can be quite hot

The cappuccino with oat milk was the real highlight for me. Creamy, smooth, and absolutely delicious this was easily the kind of coffee I’d come back for again. The croissant was served warm and nicely flaky, exactly how it should be.

I also tried the coconut matcha, which was really well balanced, not too sweet and not too bitter, making it very enjoyable. The only downside for me was the signature lemon cake. It wasn’t as spongy as I expected and leaned a bit dry and too sweet for my taste. Not terrible, just not my favorite.

Overall, a great spot for a quality cappuccino with oat milk and a peaceful atmosphere. Definitely worth stopping by if you want good coffee in a calm, tucked-away setting.","Cute, kind of hidden cafe with good cappuccino and delicious Matcha (especially the Matcha Coconut drink).

I was able to see the room, but it is a space that is large even if I use it with my family, and I am looking forward to opening a new one on the second floor bar soon. Coffee also uses Arabica beans, so I think I thought about the taste and aroma.
Just be careful when you go out to the backyard, tall people","great atmosphere, amazing service, good prices, good quality and quantity, had a great time painting plaster plates and eating yummy food and good drinks"

And such lovely staff ❤️","I was recommended to Dada. My experience supported that recommendation. Lovely fresh food, well prepared - using fresh ingredients prepared on the premises. Well presented at reasonable prices. Good menu with choice of Thai and European dishes. Ensure you try their fruit and vegetable smoothies - many designed to help stay healthy.

You can genuinely taste the quality of the coffee (smooth, balanced, and thoughtfully brewed) unlike many places where the flavor is overwhelmed by a burnt aftertaste. Really good coffee, done right ❤️","I can picky when it comes to my coffee, and this place is one of the best! The espresso pulls are really smooth and not bitter. The coffee shop is simple but nice and chilled with two AC units. Combined with a few games it has, it’s a wonderful place for a coffee break.","I've ordered a caramel latte (specifically asked for just a little sweetness)
Saying that it was amazing is just an understatement. This is by far one of the best coffees I've ever had.
Vanilla latte was also good but just a little below the first one in my taste scale
The taste is rich and smooth, the foam is not too thick which is good IMHO.
The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, not too many people during lunch time.","Good filtered coffee, great quality espresso based coffee, all the tasting notes mentioned were spot on. It is just the chair , not that good for my back if its a long time sitting. But overall very awesome place to get your daily specialty coffee that is roasted by their own in the same place!",I came in for a morning coffee and was very impressed. The americano was very good and the coffee beans were very good and fresh. The place is nicely set up and decorated and the service was great. Prices are pretty reasonable. Although it’s a little small it was nice. They also serve some homemade baked goods which looked pretty tasty.

Selection is not too wide, varied but I think that's also a plus.
You can also choose your roast, light, medium or dark roast according to the coffee/latte you have selected.
But for example for a latte the medium roast (not so bitter) costs a little bit more.
Their Thai tea tastes really great, strong Thai tea flavor, you can also choose your sweetness.
Prices are good, acceptable
They have a toilet to use, toilet paper is outside the toilet to take inside with you.
All in all a nice small cafe to escape the hot heat.","The staff were polite and the coffees I tried were both great (medium and dark roasts).

There's plenty of seating and the aircon is strong.",This cafe has a very relaxing nice vibe and a few comfy chairs and ok tables available. The prices of their drinks are pretty fair and a bit cheaper comparing to similar cafes with AC. My light roast americano was not good as expected though.,"Chilled vibe with the ambient instrumental music and comfy seats and sofas. Other customers are silent so we are talking quietly ourselves! Choice of roast level for the coffees of light, medium or dark. Choice of sugar level in the iced mocha. Basque cheesecake was really similar to those I've had in Andalusia! 100% recommended.

I ordered a hot latte and a Thai ice green tea. Although the coffee was good, the green tea was just average.

The service was extremely slow (no one else there) and took 15 minutes to make our take away order. This is the main reason for the low rating score.

Only had a simple flat white, early-ish in the morning, so wasn't busy at all. We really liked it (of course this was for a bit of nostalgic Aussie coffee, not for a Thai experience!).","The only pumpkin latte except Starbucks in town, but it was too sweet…and expensive, the seat wasn’t comfortable, quite awkward to work from outside when people working inside the coworking space.","Absolutely love Bella Goose! 🪿
I’m a big fan of their smoothies and cakes every item on the menu is a hit. My favorite smoothie bowl can only be found here, and it never disappoints.

Their smoothies are beautifully presented, taste amazing, and come with generous toppings. Best of all, they’re guilt-free and perfect as a healthy breakfast option.

What really makes the experience even better is the service. Special shout-out to Jaab, the barista at this branch always friendly, polite, and genuinely helpful when recommending menu items. A true gem!

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a delicious and wholesome treat to start the day right. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Super nice café! The atmosphere was modern and felt very new.

The menu offers a decent selection of local dishes. What we tried was tasty and made with fresh ingredients, even if not particularly memorable. Portions are fair and prices are reasonable for the area.

The atmosphere is simple and relaxed, suitable for an easy, no-frills meal. Service was polite and efficient, nothing exceptional but perfectly adequate.

Overall, Thaan Aoan is a solid option if you’re nearby and looking for straightforward Thai food in a calm setting. Not a standout destination, but a reliable choice.i","This place deserves 5 stars all around, one of the best in all of Chiang Mai.

Each dish was prepared fresh and presented with care. Food was flavourful, portions large, and food quality high, all with very reasonable prices. The mango bowl was a highlight!

Service was friendly, polite, and quick without being intrusive. The restaurant has a welcoming vibe. Will definitely be back!","By far my favorite place to eat in Chiang Mai for a sit down (or to-go) restaurant.  You can eat in comfortable air conditioning or out in a beautiful outdoor rain forest type/patio setting. I have only had the breakfast (several times) and the food is delicious.

The prices are very good, portions are excellent...I would get a taxi from miles and miles away just to eat here!","Was pleasantly surprised with the meal I got here. It was next to a main road and even though I sat outside with all the planting and lights it was actually very atmospheric.
Pretty standard Thai meal of spring rolls, pad Thai and mango sticky rice but it was my last night in Chiang Mai and you can't go wrong with these classics.
Really lovely food and impeccable service and not expensive for what I got.
Very tasty and super impressed.","On my last morning in Chiang Mai I went for breakfast at this restaurant and it was great.

They have a couple variations of the classic Thai coffee drink “the dirty”.  We tried the “sense of dirty” and the “super dirty”. Both were unique improvements on the original.

Recommend the Happy Bowl and Pancakes with Mixed Fruits. Coffee was really worthwhile, coming from an Australian. Would love to come back and visit here again soon.",The avocado and poached eggs on toast was some of the best I have ever had. The side salad with balsamic vinegar and roasted tomato was a delicious surprise. Quality was incredible and will definitely be back before I leave. I aso tried the tropical pancakes which were really delicious.,"I usually don’t distrust reviews, but in the case of Lazy Lemonn, it’s impossible not to wonder how this place has achieved such a high rating. The only plausible explanation is that the reviews are seriously inflated, because the real experience falls far short of what is promised.

There were two of us, and we arrived at 8:29 a.m. As soon as we walked in, a girl told us they weren’t open yet, in a rather dry manner. I asked if we could simply sit and wait, since there was less than a minute to go and there were already other customers sitting outside. She reluctantly agreed.
What’s striking is that while we were waiting, the staff were calmly preparing things behind the counter, yet the menu wasn’t brought to us until 8:45 am, fifteen minutes after their supposed opening time. A first sign of disorganization… or indifference.

The latte was disappointing: it tasted almost entirely like milk, with no balance or character. The iced Thai tea was fine, nothing more.
The ham and cheese bagel was a complete disaster: chewy, clearly defrosted, with visible cracks on the surface. A low quality product whose appearance already warned you that the taste and quality would not justify the price.
The pancakes with tropical fruit were good, but by no means exceptional or memorable, something you can easily find in dozens of cafés around Chiang Mai without paying an “Instagram premium.”

If the food was underwhelming, the service finished sinking the experience. With the exception of one male staff member who was genuinely kind and service oriented, the rest of the staff, especially a girl wearing a hat and a black-and-white sweater, had a rude, unfriendly, almost confrontational attitude, as if serving you were a favor rather than their job.
From the moment we arrived, the feeling was clear: we were not welcome.

No one asks how the food was, not even when they see plates left half untouched. There is zero interest in customer feedback or improvement. The unspoken message is simple: pay and leave. Preferably as quickly as possible.

To make matters worse, they only accept cash, something that is not mentioned on any sign nor communicated when you arrive. In 2026, for a modern and far from cheap café, not accepting cards is simply unacceptable.

First and last time.
Don’t waste your time or money on this place with inflated reviews. Chiang Mai is full of cafés that are infinitely better, with honest products and, above all, warm and respectful service. Lazy Lemonn offers neither.

I regret writing such a negative review, as I don’t enjoy doing so, but the experience was so uncomfortable and disappointing that if it helps other customers make a better decision before coming here for breakfast, it’s worth being clear:
walk past it, it’s absolutely not worth it.","Amazing breakfast spot in the middle of city center. Service is a bit slow depending on the rush, but the wait is worth it. The weather in mid-November was bliss-if you’re lucky you’ll get one of the 5 patio tables. Reasonable price for excellent quality western-style breakfast. Everything we tried from the food to the coffee was on point.","Encore Lazy Lemon!
So disappointed Avocado on Toast SOLD out. No Avocado.

However, scrambled eggs with cheese on toast EXCELLENT! Must Order!

Strawberry and banana smoothie also 👍🏼 GREAT!

Must come again 🥳🥳🥳"

For the whole 7 days, never got tired of staying here doing nothing but relaxing. We saw many other guests staying like us for hours. All felt relaxed.
A unforgettable cozy vibe here, with breeze, birds, 8 puppies, swimming pool, soft music and the whole decorations. No need to walk out for cafes. Here it's enough.
The location is also good. Near Tha Phae Gate. Easy to walk within old city and to eastern markets out of old city. Easy to find good juice bar and Thai boat noodles within 5-minute walk.
One other best thing is, it's quite with such good location. Barely no noise of motor bike.
Would definitely come back next time.","I absolutely adore this hotel. Honestly, out of my six weeks traveling across Thailand and Vietnam, this has been my absolute favorite stay and how lucky I am I to have found this gem 💎! The place is newly renovated, lovely rooms and the atmosphere / vibe is great! Super nice outside area and pool to chill and relax. Plus they have 8 puppies! 🥹 highly recommend this place - 10/10 and nearly forgot, the owners are lovely and super sweet!","What we liked:
- great location
- really nice exterior
- dogs but unfortunately not sterilized (puppies around)
- laundry service
- staff ladies and young gentleman super nice

What we did not like:
- room was not ready at point of check-in (especially as we asked for an early check-in before arrival after 20h flight) -> we had to wait for additional 30 minutes and we did not get any offer such as a soft drink while waiting
- room 16 was on top floor with steep and narrow steps. We asked for a room on ground floor as we are not that mobile but was not possible
- room was small which is ok but what we did not like is that the bathroom was super tiny, mouldy, smelly and without window and the bed head was directly next to it
- room 16 is next to the washing machines and generator which can be quite noisy at night

So in short, pleasant stay but we were hoping for more and more customer centric service (especially by reception) e.g. making a room switch possible due to mobility issues or helping bring the suitcases up or down or having a drink while waiting until the room is ready.",Fave place. Very quirky design. Great for a day by the pool. Great food and drinks. I stayed in a tent on the second floor. Great experience. Ideal location for temples bars and restaurants. Plus there's 6 gorgeous puppies that just wander around loving attention,Literally come here every day lol. Heaven on earth and they have the cutest puppies ever.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys healthy and delicious food. Lots of menu options to explore!",This is a nice little place. I found it to be on the more expensive for Chiang Mai. We paid 416 baht for 1 açaí bowl and 1 plate of avocado toast and eggs. Other than that the food was decent!

The beef krapow was really tough and had no business being served like this. Portions were a little small too. The kiwi smoothie was refreshing and is a plus point. One thing I thought wasn't great was that they were giving away a free salad in exchange for a Google review, but I think they'll give a review regardless of a good or bad review."

They offer frappes, but not a coffee one, so I asked if it would be possible to make it. They told me they had never done it before, but were happy to try — and the result was delicious.
They made me a coffee frappe with oat milk, perfectly balanced, smooth, and very tasty. You can really tell when people put effort into something, even if it’s not on the menu. We even talked about possibly adding it to the menu in the future, because it turned out so well.
The staff were friendly and open-minded, and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming.
If a coffee oat milk frappe ever makes it onto the menu… “Totty - frappetotty” wouldn’t be a bad name 😉.
Definitely a place I’d come back to.","Awesome place with delicious drinks! They have fruit smoothies, matcha drinks, coffees, lattes, frappes, and smiles!

Ask for their médium roast and they will serve you a beautifully extracted fruity coffee like we rarely see in any coffee shop. And it is not even expensive. And on top of that they are some of the friendliest owners there is and love to share about coffee. Go, it's quite an experience.","This cafe is such a hidden gem! The coffee is absolutely delicious and aromatic — you can really taste the quality in every sip.

And they even have a cute little garden behind the house which is very calm and relaxed 🙏🏼,"A small open-air coffee shop in the middle of a tourist street.
They serve nice coffee (if lucky you might find imported beans) along with other small snacks such as sandwiches and croissants. The price is quite reasonable.

A nice place to stop, take a break from the busy life, read a chapter from a book, or just have a good chat with a friend.","Happy Monday Cafe is a cafe that exudes a charming, laid-back vibe that immediately sets you at ease.

The drink we tried was the Coconut Coffee and their signature Happy Monday. They masterfully merges the comforting warmth of well-brewed coffee with the tropical twist of coconut. The coconut flavour was far from overwhelming and instead complemented the rich, robust taste of the coffee.

I will recommend to anyone who loves coffee!","Intrigued by the bric-a-brac inside, I walked in the coffee bull school and interrupted Aungkarn while he was teaching a student. That did not fuss him; to the contrary - he included me in his lesson.

The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I ordered an organic cacao and it was delicious. Definitely a place to come back to 🧋☕🍪💕😊🫶","This place is a boutique cafe. The boutique has a plethora of hand craft wood work, from practical kitchen ware like chop sticks, ladles, photo frames and item meant for display.  The coffee and food is the main draw for me.  Latte from espresso machine with a selection of light roast to dart roast. The medium roast is entirely Thai local coffee beans with a medium body and nutty flavour. Pastries are great too. Banana croffle, mango sticky rice we had were well presented and look really nice. A place to hang out for 2 hours, browsing through the wood crafts and enjoy the latte and pastries. The wall was well decorated. Highly recommended.","Got the whole space to ourselves on a Saturday morning at Level 1. Started the day with their bakes and coffee.

The atmosphere and setup is  relaxed There's actually a second floor but wasn't available for us at that time. Service is really good. The attendants are attentive.

It's quite a variety retail as well as an ice cream shop. Great place to chill and relax.","So for all coffee enthusiasts and snobs, this is the place. I’m a very passionate home barista and annoying as hell as a customer because the coffee almost never meets my expectations. This was the first place in ages to deliver more than expected!

The vibe is immaculate, the staff friendly, chill and attentive, the music is a vibe and fits well, the cookie slapped and the coffee…
well I had one and immediately after, ordered a second.

Especially the Chiang Rai Saenchai Estate was brutally good as a flat white.
What awaits you are first class beans, kind of the best machine on the market (Kees van der Westen Spirit- if you know, you know), Mahlkönig EK43 OG Grinder and other MK grinders + even one from Ditting.

And the homies know how to use the gear. So you’ll get what you pay for!

They also offer beans to buy, drip bags, ice cream, apparel and more. Amazing place for enthusiasts.","The coffee here is excellent — high quality with a great selection of beans, offering a rich yet well-balanced flavor. The atmosphere is just as impressive: calm, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed.

The location is unbeatable, right by Ta Phae Gate. It’s a perfect spot to work while watching people come and go, with the old city wall right in front of you. A great place to slow down and enjoy both the coffee and the surroundings.","Came here for our last day in Chiang Mai while we waited for the train. Was a great chill space to sit and watch the busy road outside. Great location. Little bit of calm in amongst the hustle and bustle of old town.

Really cool selection of drinks. We also got a bunch of food. Was hearty and filling. Spent just under 1000 baht but it felt worth it for the food, aircon and place to relax before the  trek out.","I found this place when I made a visit to Tha Pae Gate, tried out their americano orange and it was perfect!

I also love the coffee presentation. They really put effort in presenting the coffee just the way it is pictured in the book menu.

Nice ambience, especially in the afternoon and evening while enjoying the view of Tha Pae Gate and its surrounding.

The seasoned potato wedges served on the side are a highlight as well, providing a satisfying texture that beats standard fries.

This shop deserves more attention, please walk by if you are looking for a wholesome experience.",Tasty coffee to go for a really good price. The place is quite small but has few seats in case you want to have your drink there.,"I ordered an iced mocha, it came with too much ice (there was barely any milk in it). I asked to make it with less ice and that’s what I ended up with (see picture). The taste is pretty good but prices are not exactly cheap so I would expect a full cup, not half full.

The salads took more than 30 minutes and were brought only after I mentioned the waiting time. The pizza arrived after about 40 minutes in total.

Unfortunately, this was one of the worst dining and countdown experiences I have ever had.

The food quality was extremely poor. The dishes were served cold, bland, and tasteless. We waited an unreasonably long time for our food, and when it finally arrived, it was not worth the wait at all. At one point, we only wanted to ask for the bill, but even that process took a long time.

In addition, there were serious problems with the service. Our order was forgotten, and communication with the staff was very difficult, as they did not seem to understand what we were asking for. Everything felt chaotic and unorganized. What was most unacceptable was that a female staff member openly argued with customers, which was very unprofessional.

Moreover, for such an important event as a New Year’s countdown, there was no manager or supervisor present to take responsibility or manage the situation. This made the overall experience even more disappointing.

This was my first time visiting your restaurant, and it will definitely be my last. It is very unfortunate that my first New Year’s countdown experience of the year turned out to be so unpleasant. I felt extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with both the service and the management.

I hope you will take this feedback seriously and improve your service and staff management in the future, especially during impor","Great location by the river and friendly accommodating staff. We ordered 3 dishes and only 1 dish actually taste good (the rice with fluffy omelette and prawns) although a bit too spicy (I requested for reduced spicines). The pasta with soft shell crab comes with white sauce (taste a bit like cloying beschamel sauce) which doesn't go with the crab. The sour pork entree is too salty and too sour, unbalanced flavour overall. The live music outside clashes with the live music from next door restaurant (this is definitely not their fault) but staff are happy for us to chose to sit inside. Price point on the mid-upmarket scale.","Beautiful setting with a fantastic view of the Old Bridge and the lively bars and restaurants across the Ping River. This place has so much potential, though it feels like it could do a bit more to match the beauty of its surroundings. The atmosphere comes entirely from the location - not from the setup or the music. I came around 5:30 pm for sunset and was surprised to find it almost empty, despite the stunning scenery. Hopefully, they’ll refine the experience in the future.","This place quite calm and has delicious food. Stuff are very kind and prices are acceptable. Best place for calm, dinner and drinking","The food was all very very good! The service was nice and accommodating the food didn't come super fast, but this isn't a fast past vibe it's a place you go to relax and enjoy atmosphere. My kids love the the playground and there were kid friendly items on menu. We spent the evening enjoying music and food. I almost didn't go because of recent bad reviews but I'm very glad we did"

The place is perfect for hiding away from the afternoon sun to sit back and relax with good music.","Hidden gem doesn’t even begin to describe it, after countless cafés around Chiang Mai, this one stands out as unforgettable.
When coffee is done right, it demands your full attention. No distractions, no extras, just you and the cup, completely absorbed in its flavor and aroma.","Exceeded all expectations — truly a hidden gem, even after visiting over 50 cafés in Chiang Mai.
A truly great cup of coffee makes you only drink coffee — nothing else. You’re fully immersed, surrounded by the aroma and flavor.

Started with the Citrus Boy. I love citrus-based drinks, and this one nailed it — a beautiful blend of citrusy sweetness, vanilla, milk, and espresso. Topped with a slice of orange soaked perfectly in espresso.

Immediately ordered a second — the Black Amber. I’m a big fan of truffle, so this was a no-brainer. It came with a passionfruit crisp on top, and right before serving, they sprinkled fresh black truffle over the coffee — the aroma and depth it added were incredible.

The vibe and music? Spot on. Whether it’s sunny or rainy, this place just makes you feel calm, cozy, and safe.

I drink and drunk here👉ig：OneCupWithYv","This quirky coffee shop, with its small sign and retro minimalist design, offers unique but limited coffee options. The citrus coffee with milk blend, surprisingly delightful, is a must-try. The service is excellent, transporting you to an oldies feel coffee shop. However, the price may not be the cheapest for coffee, it’s worth for trying",Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops in Chiang Mai. Very minimalistic and modern cafe that is also a listening bar. When we were there they played very experimental tunes. Jazzy-electro-krautrocky music. This place is also good if you have to do some work. Cappuccino is delicious and prizes are very fair.

Located at 4F inside an old mall, near to Warorot market. Ordered filter coffee, local beans, nice coffee. The most attractive points for me is the large space, tranquil environment, unlike those famous coffee shops. Great view of quiet streets around. The only inconvenient things is the toilet is located at 6F, you need to get the key from shop owner in order to access the toilet.
If you are looking for a place to enjoy and book and a cup of great coffee, this is the place i highly recommend.","We spotted this cafe on Google Maps and decided to check it out and were pleasantly surprised by how good the drinks were.

We ordered the Rainy Pink and Haven't We Met and were truly impressed by the flavour profiles and presentation of the drinks.

Highly recommend popping by for drinks if you're in the area.","I found this coffee shop thanks to a recommendation from someone I met during a tour yesterday. It is very hidden inside a clothes market, and you have to climb all the way up to the 4th floor. Honestly, while walking up the stairs, I kept doubting myself and wondering if I was going the right way.

But once you reach the top, you will be rewarded with a cozy space, great vibes, and really good coffee. The journey makes it even more special.

We loved the banana and nutella, and the cheese, as well as the plain one.

Service was quick and tables are often at a premium.

The coffees were okay.",This is the best breakfast spot in all of Chiang Mai. The roti and tea is incredible. Staff are super friendly and hospitable. A must try if you're in Chiang Mai. They only cook in coconut oil and don't use MSG.,"This restaurant, located on the street, is, in my opinion, the best in Chiang Mai. The staff here are incredibly kind, delightful, and eager to communicate. Having enjoyed Roti in various cities such as Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, Bangkok, and Phuket, I must say that this experience is truly amazing. If you're looking to enjoy Roti in the morning, this restaurant is a must-visit.
※ They are using healthy coconut oil and goat milk straight from the farm.","Run by 3 macik, was there at 11am and it's no crowd, Likely I'm the late one there. The restaurant had moved and is now across the road, you can park along the road to visit the restaurant, just be sure to avoid the red and white pedestrian tiles. The food they served looks fantastic, Will need to visit at least few more time to taste them all.
Tips: ate the mutton curry, the mutton is soo tender, it's probably fresh from Hamza farm, don't miss the goat milk and lastly the ice lemon tea is huge for 59baht.","While walking in the morning around the temples we found their stalls and were attracted by the smell and we decided to stop. We enjoyed the roti with cheese, children got the spinach cheese roti and the coffee with goat milk was super tasty 😋😋😋. Miss Juju is super friendly and she also gives us details about their own farm. The opening time is 6am until 11am."

Stopped by for breakfast and coffee, and I was impressed from the moment I walked in. The place is clean, has a cozy atmosphere, and every breakfast dish was fresh, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious.

The coffee was aromatic and rich, clearly made from high-quality beans and prepared with care. A must-try for all coffee lovers!

What stood out the most was the exceptional service – special thanks to Khun Dew❤️, who was incredibly friendly and helpful. Always smiling, polite, and ready to give great recommendations. It really made the experience feel warm and welcoming.

You can sit upstairs, play billiards, enjoy drinks or snacks, and even go out to the balcony to smoke – which is very rare in Chiang Mai!

I really like their original and creative packaging – small “egg” jars that keep the smell perfectly sealed, super practical for storage. Big plus for that!

They offer a good selection of strains – both indoor and outdoor, all Thai-grown, plus sometimes imported ones from Amsterdam. When I was there, they had two hash types, which is great – not every shop has that!

Prices are fair:

Outdoor from 70 THB

Indoor from 300 THB to 450 THB

Quality is very nice – great smell, clean burn, good effect.
The owner has been running coffee shops in Chiang Mai for years – this is already his second location, and you can really feel the experience and passion.

Also, the owner is extremely friendly, polite, and VERY HELPFUL – speaks very good English, so it’s easy to communicate and ask about strains or recommendations.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for authentic Thai weed, good hash, and a comfortable chill spot to relax. 🌿💨","Best cannabis lounge in Chiang Mai by far.

I'm not an ice cream person but their matcha soft serve is delicious, creamy smooth, right amount of matcha, not bitter.

Excellent coffee a normal price, good cookies and chill vibe setting, don't miss this!

They offer 3 types specialty coffee in light, medium, and medium-dark roast.
For your milk based coffee they also have oat milk.
I tried the medium roast in espresso and it's a great acidic entry for anyone who wants to try something different, come and see how espresso can be something else than plain bitterness and dry after taste.
Good coffee beans is great, but they know how to pull a shot correctly, and espresso enthusiasts know it's not about pressing a button on an expensive machine.

As usual, not much food to go with it but they have exceptionally good cookies almond or chocolate, don't let their look fool you these are dense!
The pricing is really friendly too, usually this type places charge you ""specialty money coffee"" , and the setting is their garden with tables laying around, chill jazz music..

The street still has some traffic but very slow paced, not a major route so I'd consider this a chill place for South Asia 😅",Very cosy and quiet coffee shop with affordable coffee and different kinds of roasts.

That said, their Thai tea with almond milk was frothy and absolutely delicious, and the fresh fruit juice smoothies were refreshing and flavorful. I also tried the breakfast sandwich on fresh whole-grain bread, which was excellent—hearty, flavorful, and satisfying. However, I wasn’t informed that the sandwich included cheese, which was an issue for me as I’m lactose intolerant. The staff were super friendly and warm, but they could benefit from being more knowledgeable about the menu and its ingredients.

The restaurant has a chill, laid-back vibe, with quiet music that makes it a great place to study or relax. There's both an air-conditioned indoor space and outdoor seating where you can enjoy the bustle of the busy street.

Overall, the vibe and drinks stood out, and the food was tasty, but a bit more attention to menu transparency and vegetarian options would elevate the experience.",I have officially visited all the fernpresso locations. The coffee is excellent.  Good customer service.  The cakes and sweet have a large selection.  Located across the street from the train station. I recommend this shop,"Good price, nice latte and good service. It'll be good for working. It's spacious👍",I keep going back to Fernpresso! Great place!

The coffee was good, the chairs were very  comfortable for seating and talking. The location has wifi for laptop working. It is right next door to the hospital so there are a lot of ppl that come in and out for business and pleasure. You must be comfortable with the traffic flow of customers to enjoy the location. Once you are inside and seated, the atmosphere is fine. I will visit again.","Good place to work from if you have noise cancelling headphones. Well located if you’re living in Nimman.

Possibility to sit at the tables with regular chairs or to go for lower tables with more comfortable sofas or leather blanket.

Coffee is good. Air conditioning tends to be too high, so being a jumper with you.","This is a franchise cafe with good coffee. It definitely has franchise vibe, which is not my preference. Americano is 55thb here and it’s good",The best coffee shop around near Suan Dok hospital. You can come to chill out or working. There’s space for you to sit and have a coffee and work. Pleas come and enjoy your time!!,"Edit June 2023...

The staff are so nice. The customer left the shop and they still hadn't finished thanking me. LOL. But they should change their greeting from ""Please check the menu while you wait."" It makes you feel like you have to wait. It should be ""Please check the menu first."" That would be better.

I applied for a membership card and it's the best deal in the world. Today I tried the double matcha latte. It's 50% sweet and very well-balanced. But I forgot the one before. The bottom sip is sweet and well-balanced. The top is tea. It's very strong and bitter. I like it. It's not bitter like coffee. When I stir it again, it's very well-balanced. And there are so many other menus to try. There's even a menu that supports Thai products. I'm a big fan of Thai products. There are always a lot of customers.","Thai Coffee Shop, located in front of the Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University. Delicious drinks, standard Thai coffee.
Clean shop, friendly staff.
There are about 5 tables.
Parking on the street.","⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The Friendliest Punthai Branch in Town | Essential Stop for Daily Thai Tea & Coffee on Suthep Road🥤☕
.
Punthai Coffee, Suthep Road branch, is one of the few branches in Chiang Mai located outside a gas station and right in the heart of the city. What impressed us most about this branch is the friendliness of the staff.
.
As a regular (everyday) Thai tea drinker, Punthai's 75% sweetened Thai tea has a rich and perfectly sweet flavor. With a Max Card, the price is only 27 baht per cup, which is a great value (although limited to 10 cups per month). The shop also offers promotions pairing drinks with a wide selection of desserts, including croissants, sandwiches, and even dim sum items like buns and dumplings.
.
Note: Since I came to buy food in the morning to go to work, parking on the side of the road wasn't difficult. Even on weekend mornings, you can park in front of the shop or across the street. We usually didn't have to wait long, as there were usually 4-5 staff members working at the same time during peak hours.
.
In summary, this Punthai branch This is perfect for those looking for affordable everyday drinks. It's even more worthwhile with a membership card, but parking can be difficult during the morning or afternoon on weekdays for those driving.

📍Location: Located on busy Suthep Road, right next to 7-11. Easy to find and conveniently located near Chiang Mai University's Suan Dok Campus.
✨The Vibe: Clean with a minimal design. Offers a bar with three high chairs and a couple of tables.
🏆Strengths: Exceptional staff friendliness (the most friendly Punthai branch we've found in town!). They offer reliable taste and great value, especially with a Max Card membership (Thai Tea at THB 27). Excellent variety of bakery and snacks, including dim sum.
💡Parking Note: Easy street parking in the early mornings and weekends; challenging during weekday peak hours.

📝Highly recommended for international travelers who want to try quality coffee or non-coffee Thai brand drinks at an affordable price. Dim sum and Thai-style bakery items are also available.","The new shop is beautiful and has comfortable seating, not cramped.
The staff provides excellent service.","The staff provided good service, the coffee was delicious, the shop area was not very large, and there was no restroom available."

Good aircon, comfortable seats, affordable drinks, soft lighting, outlets. I got a honey granola croffle and hot tea.

I was working today but I'd definitely come back on the weekend with a nice book","I love the vibe + the coffee quality and baristas skills are great. The only thing I wish was different was the opening hour, 10 seems a bit late but that only means I'd just love to have my morning coffee there :) food options are rather limited, perhaps adding fresh pastries like croissants would be a good idea!","A nice place with great greens and environment to have a cup of dark roasted americano. The coffee is well balanced and strong in taste but yet not too acidic.
Nice environment for a quiet afternoon enjoying your sip of coffee.
Friendly barrister and staff even though I speak a foreign language.
Got 300g of roasted beans for self brewing and making.","Cute and comfortable specialty coffee shop with a small selection of good Thai beans. We tried two pour-overs, and both were fantastic. The space is filled with plants and has a relaxing feel. We got to connect with the owner, who is really kind and knew we were interested in specialty beans, so he showed us a variety of beans and gave us recommendations for a couple really good ones.","The coffee is very good and served in lovely cups. Beautifully presented.

We didn't eat there, as we only wanted coffee.

The most sad thing is that lone fish are kept in sad conditions in vases. They can't swim due to the plant roots and it is no life for a poor living creature. There are many fish in small little vases.

They would do much better to release the fish and keep the plants only.

🙏🙏I hope that the owners will read this and make a change. 🙏🙏

The shop is really lovely and books are available to read or flip through.

The coffee as I said was excellent 👌"

The matcha is delicious and worth the price. I would like to inform the shop that the smell of cigarettes from the shop's smoking area. As a customer who is allergic to cigarette smells, it spoils the atmosphere while drinking coffee and has to endure the smell all the time in the shop. I would like to ask the shop to consider changing/moving the smoking area away from the customer area and adjusting the direction of that area so that the smell does not enter the shop area. I personally like the shop very much, but I would like to inform you that if this problem persists, I may decide not to return to use the service again, which would be a great pity.","I felt the Christmas spirit a month before.
It's small, but I like that I can stay for a long time.
I appreciate the outlets at the tables.
Coffee is a given.
It's a shame that there aren't many hot drinks besides coffee, but I enjoyed a refreshing apple tea.","This small, relaxed shop, located in the alley next to Wat Suan Dok in Chiang Mai, exudes a cozy vibe. The white and wood accents are pleasing to the eye. There's ample seating both inside and outside, and it's not crowded. It's a great place to relax and get some work done.

They serve spaghetti, steaks, salads, wraps, and sandwiches — all tasty and reasonably priced. The coffee and matcha are also really good.

Overall, it’s a comfortable spot with good food and drinks.","A newly open cafe at CMU, good location and free paring space. Available both European and Thai food menu. The price is quite high in average, but b8g portion.","My new favourite coffee shop in Chiang Mai. This place ticks all the boxes for me.

Fern Forest Cafe is a true gem tucked away in the city. The moment you walk in, you’re surrounded by lush greenery and tall trees fresh, shaded, and incredibly peaceful. It feels like escaping into a secret garden right in the middle of Chiang Mai.

The atmosphere is perfect for relaxing and staying awhile. Many international visitors love spending time here, and it’s easy to understand why, it’s calm, charming, and beautifully natural.

I ordered the tiramisu and coconut cake, and both were excellent. The tiramisu was rich and well-balanced, the coconut cake light and fragrant without being too sweet.

The yuzu cold brew coffee was also fantastic refreshing, smooth, and a perfect pairing with the desserts.

If you’re looking for a serene garden café with great cakes and quality drinks, this is definitely a must visit in Chiang Mai.
Highly recommended.","It's a popular place with people waiting in line for a table. We ordered a fruit smoothie and the black forest chocolate shake. Both were amazing. The smoothie was bursting with flavor while the shake, topped with tiny squares of cake and a cherry, was sweetly thick. The rich green curry goes well with the roti. The tumeric rice is well balanced, with fried battered fish fillets. Service is fast despite the place fully packed. Ambience is an oasis of forest in the middle of the city.","Delicious food, great ambience and very professional and polite staff.

The food came in a timely manner, seemingly fresh and perfectly cooked. We had the club sandwhich and pasta salmon with pesto. They got our orders right and it was prepared perfectly. The salmon was juicy and flavorful and cooked to perfection. I'm from Norway so I know salmon, and I was very happy with it.

The club sandwhich was also really good and presented beautifully. There could have been more fries, but it was good as is too.

We also ordered the mango/passion fruit smoothie and the berry smoothie. Tasted as expected, very good 🤗

The ambience is very calm, chill with smooth jazz playing at the perfect level. Of course they fern theme in itself makes it feel like you're close to nature and it's the perfect place to eat.

Staff was very polite and served all our needs.

All in all a good place to eat for a chill meal. Their desserts seemed amazing but we didn't order any.","A sweet little place making you feel right in the lap of nature with great food, ambient music and sound of water.

Food quantity and quality are both good with one of the best Caramel Milkshakes!
The tropical and fruit bowls are a little too cold (need atleast 30 min outside for the temperature to come down to being eatable). Hence one piece of advise will be to kindly keep them in a little less colder place before serving so that they can be eaten straightaway.

Loved the rest.","This charming little restaurant and café is a true hidden gem, beautifully surrounded by lush greenery that creates a calm and relaxing atmosphere from the moment you arrive. One of the highlights is the peaceful pond filled with colorful koi carp, which adds a special, almost meditative touch to the place. The thoughtfully designed indoor seating is cozy and inviting, making it a perfect spot to slow down, enjoy good food or coffee, and simply soak in the tranquil surroundings. Also calculate some waiting time for a free table if you come in the afternoon."

They have given effort to make it look like one from the walls, chairs, desks and everything. Staff looked friendly. Service was good. Just went there for a coffee and it was good too. Recommend. Love from 🇱🇰","We had passed by this cafe several times before finally deciding to stop in, and we’re so glad we did. From the outside it already caught our attention with its unique style, but stepping inside was even better. The atmosphere was super cool and creative—something about the design and interior gave us this futuristic, almost “Mars-like” vibe. It’s definitely not your average coffee shop; every corner feels thoughtfully designed and Instagram-worthy.

We ordered their signature drinks along with coffee, and both were excellent. The flavors were rich and well-balanced, clearly made with care, and the presentation was just as impressive. It’s one of those places where you can tell the drinks are crafted to stand out, not just served.

Beyond the drinks, the overall experience was really enjoyable. The seating was comfortable, the music matched the vibe, and it was the kind of place where you can relax for a while—whether to chat with friends, read a book, or just enjoy the ambiance.

This cafe has such a cool personality that makes it stand out in town. We left already planning to come back again, not only for the great drinks but also for the one-of-a-kind atmosphere. A must-visit if you’re looking for something different and stylish!","I ended up at MARS.cnx on a whim, and it instantly felt different. The space has this surreal, almost dream-like vibe — part art gallery, part cozy hideaway. The design is cool, and the music? Absolutely spot-on. It creates this perfect atmosphere that makes you want to stay longer.
I only had a cappuccino, but the place is definitely a hidden gem for a creative, laid-back escape.","The space is modern yet minimal, with warm wooden tones and big windows that let in lots of nature light. Their signature drinks are delicious especially the cold brew and dirty coffee.
The staff are friendly and the vibes feel peaceful. One of definitely worth visit.","MARS.cnx gets very positive feedback overall — high ratings, particularly for its atmosphere, theme, creativity, and vibe. It seems to be less about being a serious gourmet food destination and more about the experience: décor, ambiance, drinks, photo opportunities. If you go expecting that, you’re likely to enjoy it a lot. If your priority is large food portions, a super quiet café for studying, or cheap coffee, there might be better choices."

Lots of comfortable seating, WiFi and electrical outlets.","1. We waited and waited for our order. Finally I had to go to the counter to ask what happened... the sandwich was already cold... they had to warm it up again. It wasn't that busy, either.

2. I asked to have our table cleaned... the server cleaned the table and wiped the crumbs from another customer's order onto the floor!!! No sweeping up.

The service really needs to be improved.

Nice People, Bad Training.","Super comfy. Waiting in here for almost 5 hours (I got night flight) and everything in here is perfect. The ambience is very good.

And you can also walk to 7 eleven, just 2 minutes walking to grab a snack","This double story building is situated opposite the Suan Dok gate on the western side of the most in Chang Mai old town.

Their Cappuccino was pretty solid and around 80 baht.

The eggs benedict were missing the hollandeise sauce, but they had their own personal twist which was very good!","I had a fantastic breakfast at this cozy restaurant right in the center of Chiang Mai, just a short walk from Wat Phra Singh.

Quiet enough to enjoy coffee and read a book. They take card (5% surcharge) and cash. Food, coffee and drinks were great. Interior and exterior were nice. Beside it is their hotel. Nice place to check out!","This place was extraordinarily exceptional. A beautiful and aesthetically decorated place. Our experience  in Chiang Mai was enhanced due to this cafe that I found on Booking.com. Now this Cafe will be my go-to whenever I visit Chiang Mai again. The location is very close to the Chiang Mai gate where all the action takes place. The rooms were very beautiful, modern and very comfortable. Each room has a small balcony to enjoy the morning sun or the afternoon siesta. The cafe has very friendly and polite staff at check-in as well as the breakfast kitchen. The owner-Ms. Pree and her husband are delightful people who makes you feel you are home away from home. The morning breakfast is also very good with excellent coffee that you can buy from the cafe. It is locally grown and has a hint of the taste of the hills around Chiang Mai. The thai food selection for the breakfast was delicious and I am still craving for it miles away. They also had some very good vegetarian options. Moreover, they also helped arrange all the tours that I took at Chiang Mail with a 10% discount. Do not book tours at the airport, they were more expensive than the ones I got from Pran Cafe. We were there during the Loh Kratong festival hence the Cafe was fully booked. I wished we could have stayed longer..this place was one of the highlights of our incredible time in Chiang Mai. I came away feeling that I left my extended family back at this cafe. I was also traveling with my 83 year old father who was very comfortable and happy at this beautiful cafe. Also, did I say that the plants and flowers in this cafe makes one feel that they are in paradise. I will surely be back to this location. Book your whole stay in Chiang Mai at this place..you will not regret it. Wifi and all other modern amenities are great.","Cute cafe with tasty food and delicious cappuccinos!

Spent a good hour just chatting with him and soaking in the Songkran chaos on the street. Ended up staying for a beer and enjoying the moment.

Lann is one of those rare little cafés that feels intentionally beautiful without trying too hard. Tucked right in front of a hotel spa (yes, that kind of vibe), it’s the perfect spot to decompress before or after pretending you live a slower, more elegant life.

There’s easy parking (already winning), and once inside, you immediately feel how much care the owners put into every detail. The space blends classic Thai rattan textures with clean, modern architecture, creating a mood that’s equal parts cozy, stylish, and quietly luxurious. It’s the kind of place where you sit down and instantly lower your voice without knowing why.

Great coffee, calm energy, and an atmosphere that makes you want to stay longer than planned—whether you’re post-spa, pre-meeting, or just escaping Bangkok chaos for a moment.

Highly recommended if you appreciate good design, thoughtful spaces, and cafés that feel like a small retreat rather than just another caffeine stop","Had a wonderful experience at LANN Cafe’ in Chiang Mai. I tried their signature chili fried rice, which was full of flavor with just the right level of spice — absolutely delicious. The mango passionfruit frappe was refreshing, perfectly balanced, and a great match for the meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and the location is lovely, calm, and convenient (at the heart of the center area) for relaxing or enjoying a meal. Highly recommended if you’re looking for great taste, good service, and a nice atmosphere.","You have to come eat here! So delicious and super cute vibes!

Their breakfast was top tier! The bread they brought to the table was so fresh and very delicious! I try to stay away from bread but I literally almost finished the entire basket! That’s how good it was!

very instagramable and cute for photos. The staff was friendly!","Great breakfast place in Chiang Mai center! I was desperately searching for a breakfast spot where I can have a nice meal before touring the center of Chiang Mai. They have a very nice menu and if the decor is very relaxed and beautiful. The service was wonderful! I had a breakfast platter with bacon,ham, eggs, sausage, and tomato. Fully recommended!","LANN CAFE is a charming spot on the edge of the Old City. The atmosphere is relaxing, especially in the garden area. The space is small and cozy, thoughtfully designed with a stylish touch. Prices are on the higher side for Chiang Mai, but still inexpensive compared to most European cities. Service was fast and the staff were friendly and attentive. The place is clean, and the brunch was delicious. Overall, I definitely recommend it!"

I am not a big gin fan but the blend of gin with the other elements was great. The place is very Insta worthy as are the drinks. However they charge a 10% surcharge on all drinks which aren’t cheap to begin with. The place was pretty empty so  it didn’t have the best atmosphere. I think if they reduce some of their prices on their non signature drinks they would have more people coming in because it is a nice place to hang out .

Just go support and enjoy her",Dee Dee is such a nice lady and hostess and the place has such a cute ambience.  Her prices of food is amazingly low at about 1/2-1/3 the price of other places we tried. The breakfast is so big and filling I struggled to finish it. First class food at a more budget price.

I’ve been in hundreds of cafes, plantations, resorts all around the world that all specialise in coffee in all forms and I have had plenty of really good coffee.

Make sure you get the special blend, it really is special.","Around Town Coffee in Chiang Mai is a total gem—great vibes, friendly barista, and seriously good coffee. The space feels cozy but stylish, perfect for hanging out a bit!","This guy is the best barista I've had the pleasure of encountering during my stay in Asia (I've been to at least 50 different cafes on my trip). A real pro. He owns the cafe and nailed everything about the establishment. The vibe is relaxed and cozy. The pricing is ridiculously low, it really should be higher for this excellent quality (I told him)! Coffee tastes really, really good, and the latte art is... well, see for yourself in the pics. Most importantly though, he's such a nice person.

We quickly became friends!
I recommend the ""Dirty"" drink (his is excellent), and of course the hot lattes so you can see his amazingly extraordinary latte art.

Even if you're not thirsty, you should stop by to talk to him!",Flat white was very strong for medium roast. Glad did not go with the dark roast as it looked pretty ominous. Not a welcoming barista.

1. **Pomelo Salad:** This refreshing dish was a delightful start to my meal. The pomelo was perfectly ripe, and the combination of flavors—crunchy vegetables and zesty dressing—made it a vibrant and invigorating experience.

2. **Fire Chicken Curry Noodles:** The star of the show! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the chicken was tender with just the right amount of spice. The rich curry sauce was bursting with flavor and left me wanting more—I highly recommend it for spice lovers!

3. **Bread of Pork:** This dish was a comforting addition to my meal. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the bread was soft and perfect for soaking up all the delicious juices.

It’s na nice AC space with some good tables and chairs. My hot cappuccino was below average quality, but the value is not bad given this location and the price.",Prices range from 30-35 Baht for a hot cold coffee Matcha etc and 40-45 for a smoothie in a clean quiet spacious aircon atmosphere.

The school in the front is a pretty building, which enhance the whole view","Air conditioning, fast service and excellent quality drinks stands for five stars.

Genuinely the worst drinks i had in Chiang Mai.

Could not finish the coconut matcha, as it was bitter and watery. When served, no coconut water was visible. I assume they ran out of it by the end of the day and just poured in the few drops that was left.

The orange coffee was okay, but look at the amount of ice - full to the top. I saw the barista add even more ice right before serving me, cause the cup had like 3 sips of the drink.

The people working there were nice! Just not good at making drinks. Avoid.","Coffee Place near the Three Kings Monument.
We had a double espresso & iced coconut americano.
My americano was okay but the espresso, unfortunately, was very sour and my partner didn’t drink it.
Service was great and store looks cool.","Clean and modern simple coffee shop that opens earlier than others. Helps someone like me early risers :)
Only downside I see is that there is outside table in front of of the shop but it smells due to cat’s droppings :(",Nice coffee. Have been before on previous visits.

The staff truly elevates the experience; everyone was friendly and served with a warm smile. I ordered an Orange Espresso for my friend, and the presentation was excellent.

this a hip happening place, with crowd, instragrammable

seems like many tourists more into taking photo at chan moi kao road than in coffee

we had dirty and yuzu expresso, later was good but former was nothing like the superb brew @ restr8to

our fault really as the the description was completely different this one here having honey- didn’t like the sweetness but the nice coffee aroma still there.

Coffee is just amazing and good mixture and combination with others. I really love this cafe. You can feel their soul and mind. It’s completely different from blue bottle or Starbucks.","A wonderful cafe in Old Town Chiang Mai. Small and cozy. Super nice staff. Great coffee. The best we’ve had thus far in Chiang Mai. Price is the highest we’ve paid as well.

The space is small and refined rustic. We didn’t have to wait but previously we came and gave up as it didn’t seem tables were going to turn anytime soon. They are using a VBM Espresso Machine. Nice attention to detail.","Graph has to be one of the most innovative coffee shops in the world right now. The craft they put into the drinks - avocado cream in dirty lattes, somehow blending coffee and orange juice together PERFECTLY, it’s super exciting to know that there are people passionately engaged in their craft to this extent. The location in this craft market is also wonderful, chiang mai is one of my favorite places to visit because of this genuine spirit of creativity.

Drinks were just alright, the es yen was small, the capuccino was nothing special. As others have said, many people taking pictures everywhere so it’s not that much of a relaxing atmosphere. they give you a free ice cream if you review it, that could explain a higher rating.","Roomy yet cosy joint with wavy vibes tucked down a small alley. The servings are solid, the service is cheery, and the ambiance makes the menu prices worthwhile. Not all that busy at noon on a weekend.","Nice location and delicious drink. You can take plenty of pictures here as they decorate it very nice. There is also a photobooth as well, i forgot how much it was but def give it a try.

The only thing i wanna complain was that i bought a drink but my friend wanna use the washroom. They didnt allow her to use it but requested her to buy a drink first. I found it unusual for a coffee shop like this.","Great interior. I really like old TVs showing noice as a design choice!

I don't know how this place can be rated so highly on Agoda, Booking and Google. I suspect this place has paid an internet company to boost it's ratings by giving fake high ratings. I observed 3 or 4 high ratings put in within 1 minute on google reviews most likely by the same person on the evening I stayed there.

The staff are so unmotivated and take hotel guests as intruders when we want to go back to our rooms. There are so many things wrong with this place ...rooms with no windows, super hard beds, dark and dim rooms resembling a jail cell!

The rooftop bar had only 1 table occupied at 8pm on the Friday/Saturday that i went up to take a look. There was a couple in the same lift as me coming down probably deciding the rooftop bar was not worth their baht...

To be fair some of the staff do try to make yr stay more pleasant but the systemic issues with the place are too extreme.

The owner should really take a hard look and stay in the ""hotel"" to understand the issues or maybe he/she doesn't care and just wants to keep the place afloat.

This is the worst accommodation i have ever stayed in Thailand and I felt so deceived by the high ratings to stay here!","Jai Loy is our favorite hangout place in Chiang Mai. Amazing and friendly staff which makes the rooftop bar an extraordinary experience. Food and drinks are priced cheaply with high quality.

We, especially, are always enjoying the sunset at around 6 to 7pm when the sun decends behind the mountain: priceless!

A must go place when in Chiang Mai enjoying a relaxed and chilled atmosphere.","At first I was thinking if the place will be noisy because there is rooftop bar on 5th floor and cafe on the 1st floor, but surprisingly the room was quiet! Room also clean and smells good. I stayed in a private room on the 2nd floor with shared bathroom, and the bathroom was clean.

Location is perfect, many good places that we can reach by walking distance.

Only 1 small feedback, because we have to take off our own shoes or slippers, it will be great if the accommodation can also provide slipper in the room or for us to walk around the communal area 🙏🏻","Mixed review.

We booked the same day as we were quite limited on places available in our budget, they kindly let us check in early for no charge which was great. The only room available was the standard room with no window, at £25 a night. The bed was comfy but the room was quite dingy and smelt musty. The bathroom as well had the typical sewage smell that is all too often here. Plus the A/C spat out smelly air. I think these things wouldn’t have been a problem if we had spent maybe £10 less per night, but as Thailand has so many budget stays this was one of the more expensive budget rooms but it was not reflected in the quality.
This is not to say don’t stay here it’s just a reflection of the standard room with no window, as for the price you can get better (if you book in advance not like us).

Apart from that the staff were nice and there is great seating areas down stairs and on the rooftop with a sunset view. The prices were quite expensive on the rooftop though, I suppose due to the view."

There’s plenty of seating available outside, and it feels like sitting in someone’s garden.
There’s also a cute cat roaming about :)
My husband and I are sad we couldn’t visit more often and wish we could have stayed in this neighbourhood.","Cozy spot with lush back and front patios.
The owner and staff are super friendly and cool. Banana bread is out of this world, vegan to top it. Coffee is amazing, and the mango smoothie is mmmmm.
Must visit in CNX for coffee.","This is my FAVORITE coffee spot in Chiang Mai. First of all, the coffee is so delicious and that's what counts the most.. and second it's not extra to have soy milk.

Nestled in the heart of the city, Hide Land is one of Chiang Mai's most captivating ""secret"" rooftop bars. Known for its chic, industrial-meets-minimalist ambiance, it offers a sophisticated yet relaxed escape from the bustling streets below.

As the evening approaches, the space transforms; it is a prime destination for sunset enthusiasts, with dozens of people flocking here daily to catch the golden hour. The sight of the sun dipping behind the lush green hills and the iconic Doi Suthep mountain range is nothing short of breathtaking.

Beyond the scenery, Hide Land has built a stellar reputation for its culinary and mixology offerings. The cocktails are the true stars—famous for being expertly balanced and creatively presented. Whether you prefer a classic or a signature Thai-inspired infusion, the drinks are as impressive as the vista. Complementing the bar is a menu of high-quality food that elevates the experience from a simple drink spot to a full dining destination. For anyone seeking a trendy atmosphere and a million-dollar view, Hide Land is an absolute must-visit place",The best for working or studying or just chill.

The Salmon Smash was another standout. It was fresh, full of flavor, and put together really well. The portion was generous and the mix of textures made it easy to enjoy.

The Coconut Blended Coffee was the perfect finish. It was creamy, refreshing, and had a nice coconut flavor without being too sweet.

Overall, everything tasted great and the whole place had a relaxed, welcoming vibe. We’ll definitely be back :)","This small coffee shop was a delightful find for breakfast.

Phin and Feta is, without a doubt, one of the best cafés in Chiang Mai. Everything here is made with such care and passion — you can truly taste it in every bite.

We tried their sourdough bread with real butter, and it was divine. The aroma of the butter alone was irresistible, and the bread itself was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft inside. The sourdough with avocado and salmon was an explosion of flavours — fresh, balanced, and beautifully presented.

And then there is the famous sourdough donut with cream and feta — an unforgettable experience! Light and airy dough, silky velvet cream, and the subtle touch of feta that makes it truly unique.

The owners are incredibly kind and dedicated, and their love for what they do shines through. A warm, welcoming atmosphere, excellent coffee, and food that delights all the senses — Phin and Feta is simply unmissable.

If you love good coffee and sourdough bread, this is the place in Chiang Mai."

This Old City gem offers a complete artisan experience that starts with your palate and ends with a story. Beyond their incredible hand-roasted, organic Chiang Dao Arabica coffee and exceptional homemade breads, they serve a cup with a truly unique taste profile.

Coffee Experience: Their must-try Iced Americano showcases beans roasted right on-site. But here’s what sets it apart: the taste journey. It begins with a surprisingly sweet, bright palette—notes of citrus and honey—that then transforms into a distinct, intentional, warming ""burn"" at the finish. It’s not bitter; it’s a complex, almost smoky depth that lingers beautifully. This unique progression from sweet to roasted warmth is unforgettable.

Perfect Pairings: The homemade Mum's Banana Bread (walnuts, whole wheat, honey) complements the coffee's sweetness, while their Flourless Seed & Nut Bread (no yeast/dairy) stands up to its robust finish.

More than a café—it's a destination for those who appreciate craftsmanship in both coffee and food. A must-visit for a complete, sophisticated experience in the Old City.","Absolutely wonderful spot.👍

Wonderful setting, inside old town. Filled with peaceful nature. They have Oat milk and other vegan-friendly, dairy substitutes available.
I had a wonderful oat milk latte!
Wonderful tasting organic and fresh mountain coffee; all locally sourced.

The perfect place to stop your walking and take a break.
I am now totally reenergized!

Thank you so much!

I highly recommend this place and I will come back again.","A favorite spot for getting really flavourfull good coffee. The lovely owner collects his coffeebeans in Chiang Dao and roast it in the garden with years of experience and born out of pure passion.

All the option are simply great and have a rich deep flavour. If you feel like a little adventure ask for an off-menu coffee and be suprised. Support the local family & enjoy your lovely coffee. Above all spend time talking to Noum. She truly cares and is interested in you as a person 🙏",Come back a year later. Still my best spot in Chiangmai. It's my dream to sit here and enjoy a cup of coffee every morning under such peaceful and teak style greenery setting. Another kind of 5 star enjoyment.  This year I brought home a few bags of beans as well. Hope to come back soon.  Thx Noi.,"**A Hidden Gem for Coffee Lovers**

Tucked away in the heart of Chiang Mai old town, this coffee shop is an absolute delight for anyone who appreciates great coffee and a cozy ambiance. From the moment you step inside, you're welcomed by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and a warm, inviting atmosphere.

The menu boasts a variety of high-quality coffees, from perfectly crafted espresso shots to creamy, indulgent lattes. I opted for their signature latte, and it was *perfection*—smooth, velvety, and brewed to bring out the nuanced flavors of their beans. For those who prefer something beyond coffee, their selection of homemade healthy breads and granola is equally impressive.

The owner/ barista is not only skilled but also incredibly friendly, taking the time to explain options and make personalized recommendations.

If you’re a coffee aficionado or just someone looking for a great spot to unwind, this place is a must-visit. I can’t wait to come back for more.

I'm not surprised the last Michelin recommendation is from 2023. They've milked the Michelin rec as much as they could and are now selling snacks and whatever they can.
We ordered fish (usually takes at least 20min), soup and some other dishes and we're surprised that everything was on the table within 5-10min. They've maximized efficiency over the freshness, as the fish was definitely pre-fried and then kept warm. Everything was good but nothing special. The coconut shake was too sweet. The service was efficient again, but lackluster.
Good parking if you have a car.
Would I come back? No.","I had higher expectations for a place that has Michelin star rated plates. I had the red snail curry which was very tasty and flavorful whereas the fried squid was quite chewy and bland. I thought the prices were very high compared to other local restaurants.

💭 Would definitely come back ☺️😍","This was my second visit, after my first time in April 2025. This place serves the best dirty coffee I’ve found in Chiang Mai so far. The coconut pandan cake is a must-order and, in my opinion, the best item on the menu. The cake is fragrant, not overly sweet, and has pieces of coconut meat in the cream, which adds a great texture. I recommend visiting on a weekday or at a time when most people wouldn’t usually have dessert, as it can get quite crowded.","The food was great, and I really enjoyed the coconut cake and dirty coffee. I would say the Americano with coconut water was not as good as we thought. The cafe is well-decorated with rustic interiors (natural wood), but with cutesy art pieces and postcards. You also get free stickers with purchases!

A great place to come sit and work or chat with friends.","I don't usually leave reviews for cafés but this one deserves it. Great selection of delicious cakes and coffees and the best background music selection (think 80s, Earth Wind and Fire, Stevie Wonder,  Franki Valli, Bee Gees etc).

Highly recommended.","I like this cafe because it's the only 24h cafe I found in Chiang Mai so far (but maybe there are others too). It offers wi-fi and tables with outlets, which is very convenient for working. The drinks are not very special, but they are good. And staff is very friendly and nice.","I came here a long time ago (a few years) while walking around and this time I wanted to stop in to get a coffee and wait before taking a bus to Bangkok, sadly they have gone cashless and I didn’t want to use my debit card and get an international charge so I had to leave. I remember before there were many people maybe students studying this time there was only one person. Maybe it was a bad time or maybe it’s not very popular spot. I like that it stays open 24/7 and that was also why i came here because I would need to stay past the typical coffee shop closing time of 6pm. I give it five stars because I didn’t want to rate low for something out of anyone’s control, I just felt like sharing that they are cashless now.","Poor quality food and drinks here, industrial grade food. No service, you have to pick your goods at the counter."

The coffee is really excellent - you can tell they know what they are doing. The food menu is not huge, but everything is freshly made at home and tastes absolutely delicious. The prices are very fair too, which was a nice surprise.

One thing we really appreciated was the outdoor area. They have water humidifiers set up, which makes it comfortable to sit outside even when it's very hot.

If you are looking for a good café with honest, home-cooked food and great coffee at reasonable prices, we definitely recommend this place. It is run by a lovely family and you can feel the care they put into everything.","Tanita Coffee House is a true hidden gem in Chiang Mai! The moment you step into the compound, you're transported into a peaceful, traditional Lanna-style oasis. The coffee is excellent—they use quality, local Arabica beans—and the Thai cuisine is delicious. It’s the perfect, relaxing escape from the city hustle, wrapped in beautiful old-world charm.

I ordered Pad Thai and it was delicious, full of flavor and perfectly cooked. The cappuccino was also really good.","A Hidden Gem in Chiang Mai !

Staying at Tanita House has been a designer’s dream. Every morning felt special — having breakfast in an antique furniture shop, surrounded by old timber homes full of character and charm.

Seems very famous place as many local and younger generations.

Dim lighting inside with some house or lo-fi music, it is quite noisy to me.

The latte art is very nice, but I feel maybe I pay 200 ฿ for the skill is not very necessary. I remember the cheapest options are also approaching 85 ฿ for Americano or expresso.

there is electric charge port, and free water.

The place is a hip and vibing, maybe suitable for IG photos.

Good coffee also.

It is a little loud inside but there are seating area outside as well.

Roast8ry got another store close by, but this is their Flagship store which you can tell.
Its a very fancy design and unique vibe here.
The Staff is very friendly, kind and generous.
My only minus is: the price.
I got a Machiato for 95 baht, which is the size of a normal sized espresso.
Of course this is more a lifestyle product than a regular coffee, tho for that price their coffee should be tasting next level, not average.
But besides that, a very nice coffee i recommend to visit.","Roast8ry Flagship is clearly designed to showcase professional barista skills, with a menu full of award-winning options and distinct latte art patterns. I ordered a pour-over from their selection, which was served with a nice scientific presentation. While the shop executes the technical side and the service perfectly, the experience focuses heavily on the ""performance"" of coffee. A solid stop if you enjoy a modern, showroom-style cafe environment.","Wow! This coffee art is awesome and all (when can you say you got coffee from a world champion?) but my god was this just the most balanced latte I've ever had in my life.  Great smoothness, flavor, and ambiance. The one taking my order pretty much walked me through the whole menu when it looked like I was studying the darn thing taking so long to decide 😀.

The atmosphere is really nice, perfect for those looking to bring a laptop and work for a few hours. Even though the prices are on the higher end for Chiang Mai, it is absolutely worth it.

It's a cute little cafe with lovely decorations. But you'll probably not find a table there as there are only 3 of them.

I need to learn from them how they make their coffee.","The location is relatively small, but don't underestimate how tasty their coffees are. More specifically, their dirty lattes show a sense of creativity and innovation from their owners which isn't seen in many other cafes. I specifically liked the mango sticky rice dirty latte, but I'm sure the other ones would also be delicious.","At the barista’s recommendation, I tried the salted caramel iced coffee - it was delicious! I also snagged two of their cookies to go, and the lemon curd one I’ve eaten so far is tart and yummy. They have a small cafe (maybe 3 tables) and small menu, but several unique flavors of homemade cookies like tiramisu, carrot cake, chocolate with marshmallow, and gooey macadamia nut.

The avocado cream, however, was a bit too much for our liking, and it would have been nicer if it were served warm.

Overall, it’s a nice spot for a quiet breakfast. The space is also very large, making it suitable for bigger groups as well.","2026.1.10 Sat

We just arrived in Nimman area today to check into our Airbnb and was directed to this cafe by the owner, as we were unable to do an early check-in before 3pm.

Hard pressed for time, we decided to catch our lunch here. The latte is excellent. Just a bit surprised to be served in paper cups for dine-in service. All the food we ate is excellent.

Love the ambience and love the quality of the food here !","Loved the new addition to our fav Ombra. The menu is the same. The space has different areas. Amazing for work, chitchat with a friend or having a peaceful escape. We would definitely come back. (The staff needs a better training. Maybe a minimum level of English)","Amazing brunch place! For the food, every piece in our breakfast dish was done perfectly; great flavor, and crisp texture indicating its freshness. The cool atmosphere with the outdoor greenery creates a chill place, perfect for coworking or to indulge in a good book.","Lovely place and atmosphere. The staffs are super helpful and friendly.

The food and coffee also great as well.

I'm so happy with this shop. Strongly recommended."

I left half way through my stay due to the way Amy regularly spoke to me in an aggressive and condescending way that was completely unprovoked, I couldn't even walk from my room to the door without her finding a reason to bereate me,  it was awful. I didn't even ask for a refund as I didn't want to deal with another of her outbursts.

It was very upsetting to see the way Amy treated her sweet staff, the staff members mentioned in the earlier reviews have all left.  When I stayed 4 new staff had just been hired, when I left 2 weeks later 2 had already quit, and I hadn't seen one other around so hopefully he got out too.

I wouldn't recommend staying here, every day is like walking on eggshells","I had an amazing time at creativitea, the room was super spacious, cozy, quit, clean and the bed is very comfortable. Felt very welcomed by the staff and owner. They have free laundry service, which is amazing! Very worth the already good price :)

The area is the best in town in my opinion, super quiet but very close to everything and only 10min away from the airport.","Poor coffee, poor communication from staff. The place looks decent but one of the staff shouldn't have been working and taken a day off to rest when I visited as she behaved strangely.","Such an amazing, creative space! It really lives up to the name ☺️👩🏼‍🎨🫖

Creativitea has all of my favorite things — delicious tea and coffee, journals, stickers, washi tape, and even 3 adorable kittens!

The business owner Amy is a true gem 💎 She’s incredibly sweet, welcoming, and tapped into the cultural pulse of Chiang Mai — she knows all the coolest local spots and activities!

If you’re swinging by Creativitea as a launchpad to one of the group events Amy organizes, make sure to get there a few minutes early so you can grab a tea and browse her excellent selection of journals, stationery, art supplies, clothes, water bottles, knickknacks, and all sorts of whimsy!","The owner’s energy is extremely chaotic and aggressive.  I was chastised for unknowingly walking in the ""members area"", then after calmly expressing that I feel very uncomfortable she shouted ""then you can leave!"".  Her fear-based, oppressive leadership affects the atmosphere and her sweet staff, who were the only saving grace - kind, professional, and warm despite the tension.  Not a place I feel welcome or will return to."

You can have breakfast, lunch, or brunch there until around 3:30–4:00 PM. The place feels like a combination of different shops.
You order everything at the café first, then sit anywhere you like.

I didn’t see any air-conditioned indoor area, but the outdoor atmosphere was quite comfortable — the weather was slightly rainy, and the space is surrounded by lots of greenery.

It’s also okay to do remote work upstairs for around 3–4 hours. It’s not crowded at all, which makes it even better.
Plus, there’s a separate and lovely gift shop where you can buy some Burmese traditional products.

Had an iced mint latte that was pretty awesome. The happy vibe in this shop is what happens when a proprieter loves what they do and take pride in how they do it.

Here's the extra good, since it's easy to find a great cup of coffee in Chiang Mai. It's the happy vibe.

While being relatively small in size, the walls of windows make the space feel open, warm & inviting. It is a clean, well lighted place.

The seating design has two couches, two countertops, and four tables inside, and two tables under a covered awning for coffee in a garden.

The way the indoor seating is arranged, the comfortable padded seats and tabletop provide islands of privacy in an open space. It's very well thought out. The decor also changes slightly in each mini seating area to further amplify a feeling of separation and privacy in this open setting.

The decor is also funny, happy, and bright. Kids and the kid in you will be moved towards a relaxing mindset to maybe share conversations and coffee with a friend, or doom scroll in search of the end limits of the internet. In either case, this place will add to the happy mood of your activity.

Plenty of parking. Laundry mat across the street, and  Lotus Fresh next door, as well as a wine shop to grab a bottle for later.

10/10 Fantastic!

I am very satisfied with coffee especially Cocoa The  location is near Payap university it's the best place ever","I was disappointed. It says it’s a coffee shop that’s open late, but when I got there, it’s actually more like a bar and they weren’t serving coffee at all.

I really recommend it!","I ordered Iced Vanilla Latte and it was just perfect - the right amount of coffee, milk, and vanilla flavor. The staff was super friendly and offered me a free taste of the Big Toast, which was pretty good too. But my absolute fave was the mixed fruit tart.

Amazing hiking starting off place. Parking spots available.","Excellent selection of local Thai beans for sale or extraction.

I got V60 local light roast beans over ice, highly reccomend 👌","There are two cute dogs in this coffee shop(Sometimes they are not in the shop).
I especially like the big brown dog named Taco (It sounds like ""Takoyaki"" or ""Tako( which means octopus in Japanese)"" )  because he is very charming and his behaviour and characteristics are really similar to these of my dog.
I took a lot of pictures of him : )
His is like ""a beckoning dog"" (the original one is a beckoning cat)  as he really made me want to come here.

Customers are also allowed to bring their own dogs so you may have a chance to see other cute dogs.
You can enjoy interacting with dogs without paying additional fee :) though sometimes their dogs are not in the shop.

Their Thai food tastes so good. I think their food has higher quality than other Thai food shops do.
I personally think Thai food is one of the best foods in the world ( though the country may not be the best for me to live in... I am sorry to say this. I still like Thailand as a tourist destination).","Basecamp Coffee Club is a pleasant café with a relaxed atmosphere, good coffee and tea, and several comfortable seating options. The outdoor terrace is especially nice and a good place to sit and unwind.

Inside, however, the air conditioning is very cold, so it’s not really a place to warm up. Prices are quite high, particularly for pastries, cakes, and cinnamon rolls, which feel rather expensive for the portions.

A plus point is the small courtyard with convenient parking for scooters and bicycles, as well as a sports shop next door and a small kiosk downstairs. Overall a nice stop for a drink, but noticeably pricey."

‼️‼️**I stayed in 9+ hostels in Old City over my 2 months in CNX - see my FAVS at the bottom**‼️‼️

Owner Fabien does an excellent job of making you feel at home, I’m so impressed he greets everyone by name as they come in the door!

The rooms were great, single beds - not bunks😍 I love that the girls room had an on suite bathroom but the room was so spacious and the bathroom was far from the beds - just perfect!

Beds were cozy, with a huge comforter! Mattress was classic for an asian hostel- fine but not as plush as I am used to from home.

Great wifi, lobby/cafe to work from and free coffee / tea!

🍻🗣️Islander Chiang Mai (south)
🍻🍻🗣️Stamps (east)","Had a lovely 4 night stay at One Life, it was the perfect hostel for my travel style! It was social in the sense that everyone I met was very friendly, but it is not a party vibe so I could sleep peacefully at night. Always kept very clean, and the owners are helpful to arrange tours if you'd like. Kawa, the dog, comes with the owners to work most days to hang out in the lobby and is a perfect angel! She's friendly, but if you're wary of dogs she minds her own business. They also offer a same-day laundry service that is incredibly convenient and affordable. One life is on the same street as many other hostels, so you can find lots of other travelers if you'd like. Also right along the center square of town, and down the street from a 7-11.","This hostel is surrounded with so many things depending on what you want to do, if you want night life, chill night, if you want to book activities !!! The host is called Jenny and Fabien, they are lovely and will make sure you have the most comfortable stay, so far backpacking thailand they have been the best host we’ve had, we came back after being in the south and stayed here again!! The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, shower and toilet is always clean which i think is one of the most important thing when you pick a hostel. if i visit thailand i will always always alwayssss give chiang mai a couple of days and stay here EVERY SINGLE TIME. (also they have the cutest dog ever called Kawa which is such a bonus ;)) Love u Kawa xox","Probably the best hostel I've stayed in Thailand and my favourite one here too. Super clean and affordable, and they also have a drying area at the toilet for your clothes so that it doesn't stink the main sleeping area. The bed is really comfy, and even though the room can get cold, the duvet was so nice and thick enough that you definitely won't freeze at night.

The owners Jenny and Fabien are also super friendly and are willing to help you as long as you ask. Not to mention the hostel star Kawai (think that's how it's spelt) the Shiba who's really adorable and friendly too.

Really convenient location as well, with a night market just down the road and next to the old city. Not a party hostel, but still really social if you want to. Ended up having breakfast here at the cafe (which is also the reception area) every morning instead of going out even though it might be cheaper just because I could just sit there and people would appear for you to talk to.

Ended up extending my stay in Chiang Mai by 2 nights because I had a really good time here. I know many people who ended up also staying longer because they loved the hostel. Only downside is that it is almost always booked out for each day, so any extension, you would need to check with them early. Last minute extensions are almost impossible (although I was lucky because someone cancelled on the day I was supposed to check out). Jenny and Fabien also took us to the drag show on my first day, and they booked a whole songthaew for the hostel to fetch us over.

TLDR highly recommended hostel, good location, friendly staff, social but not party hostel, great vibes.","I stayed at One Life Hostel and honestly, it was one of the best parts of my Chiang Mai trip. The hosts were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and they even have a super cute Shiba Inu (sorry, I forgot the name but she made my mornings!).

The rooms are unique and thoughtfully designed. They offer both private rooms and dorms, which is perfect depending on how you’re traveling. The common area is cozy and great for meeting other travelers, and they even provide free snacks and beverages which is a lovely touch.

Located in a great area with lots of restaurants and cafes nearby, it’s super convenient. I’ll definitely be staying here again when I’m back in town!"

From the moment I arrived, the whole place felt incredibly warm, cozy, and welcoming — the kind of hostel where you instantly feel at home. The atmosphere is calm and comfy, perfect for relaxing after exploring the city.

The staff and service are truly exquisite. Everyone is friendly, attentive, and genuinely cares about the guests. They even helped me organize transportation to Mon Jam, which made the trip completely stress-free and easy — a huge plus!

The bedding deserves a special mention: the laundry was spotless, fresh, and super comfortable. It’s one of those small details that makes a big difference, and here it was done perfectly.

On top of all that, the café is lovely and adds so much character to the hostel. Great vibes, great people, and great service all around.

A huge shoutout to P'Emma, P'Chonnicha, and P'Suthep for their professionalism and hospitality🙌I’ll definitely be back!","Highly recommended youth hostel! The place is tastefully decorated, absolutely gorgeous, and has such a vibrant vibe. It’s not just a hostel—it also doubles as a café, and their coffee and drinks are truly delightful. The hostel itself is set in a lovely environment, with spotlessly clean shared bathrooms, incredibly soft beds, and a delicious breakfast. What’s more, the two female staff members are exceptionally warm, outstanding, and dedicated to serving every guest with care. I’ll definitely be coming back again!"

Must do cafe while in Chiang Mai!

Such a pleasant cafe to get the juices flowing... We ordered a Khao Soi which was the best we've ever had... also had a latte which tasted fantastic 😋

The massage was really good, and I loved the big complimentary bowl of soup — the pineapple ginger pork rib soup and passionfruit tom yum were super yummy. The drinks tasted great too.

Definitely worth checking out if you’re in Chiang Mai.","Of all the places I've been to eat and drink, this is probably my favorite. It is such a nice place, the atmosphere is pretty chill. But the thing is this place also has the best hot chocolate I've tried and they have options on how yoh want your hot cocoa. And the coffee they serve is also very good with different options as well. I get the americano every time i go to a new cafe and I can say it was one of my favourites of all time.

She does an awesome job!,"Good location, near tourist attraction, food market, old city. Comfortable room and nice staffs.","How unpleasant!

This is the first time I’ve had such a dreadful experience before even stepping foot in a hotel. I booked through Airbnb, and everything seemed fine until a few days later, I got a message from the host saying there’d been a “glitch” in their reservation system and asking me to cancel the booking. That alone is completely unacceptable for any hotel, but unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there.

When I went to check the cancellation terms, I saw it’s a strict no-refund policy. Now that’s where it starts to feel really dodgy. The host surely knows the policy, so why ask me to cancel instead of doing it from their end? Sounds very sketchy like a tactic to keep the money and turn around saying, “Oh, the guest cancelled it!”

I’ve now messaged them asking them to cancel, since they’re the ones backing out. and surprise, no reply yet. I know it might be early to judge, but honestly, the whole thing feels deliberate.","The rooms are gorgeous. Very spacious, beautiful and clean! The location is good, not noisy at night. There were two showers❤️ I really felt very comfortable. It was nice that shampoo and conditioner were prepared for guests, in beautiful, non-disposable jars, as it seemed to me, not the worst quality.
It should be noted that there is no 24-hour reception.
The problem with the room is the mosquitoes that bit at night. But judging by the fumigators, the owner is aware of this, only ours turned out to be empty. And the main problem is the old and very crushed mattress and very bad pillows, it is not comfortable to sleep.
If this problem is solved, this can become the best hotel in Chiang Mai)","The location is excellent, only 100 meters from Baixiang Gate. It is very convenient for dining and shopping nearby. It is only 150 meters away from Feng Feifei Pork Knuckle Rice. There is a 7-11 nearby. There are many places to eat and enjoy local cuisine. There is also a night market. The room is very clean, comfortable and warm. The service is very good. You can walk to the ancient city. It is very centrally located. Recommended"

The coffee was genuinely great, and the service was friendly and quick.

Definitely a spot worth checking out in Chiang Mai.","Review for On the Way Cafe, Chiang Mai

On a bright and sunny Sunday around noon, I found myself drawn to On the Way Cafe in Chiang Mai. The retro-inspired sign outside caught my eye, promising a unique experience within. As I entered, Sun Rai’s San Francisco Street was playing softly, adding a warm, nostalgic vibe to the sunny atmosphere. The upbeat melody reminded me of lazy Sunday mornings in a foggy coffee shop back in San Francisco—only here, the sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a golden glow across the room.

The cafe itself has a cozy yet vibrant charm, with vintage touches that feel thoughtfully curated. It’s the perfect place to unwind, inviting you to sit back and take in the bright day outside while savoring something delicious.

I opted for their coconut coffee, intrigued by the blend of local flavors. It was fantastic—smooth and creamy, with just the right hint of coconut that brought a refreshing twist without overpowering the coffee. The drink felt like a mini-vacation in itself, blending the comforting richness of coffee with a touch of tropical escape.

On the Way Cafe captures that ideal balance between nostalgia and novelty. Whether you’re reminiscing about foggy mornings in San Francisco or enjoying the sunny charm of Chiang Mai, this little gem provides a welcoming spot to pause, reflect, and savor the moment. It’s a must-visit for anyone looking to experience a taste of creativity and warmth on a beautiful, sunlit day in Chiang Mai.","Decent matcha latte for 60 baht

Phi SelectedTEA is a small, beautifully run matcha spot and truly one of the most special places I discovered in Chiang Mai. It’s a hidden gem — the kind of place you feel genuinely lucky to stumble upon, and absolutely worth seeking out.

The owner is incredibly friendly and generous with his knowledge. Having lived in Japan for many years, he brings a depth of experience that you can taste in every cup. You can try and compare different matcha varieties, all prepared with great care, intention and traditional technique. The quality is outstanding.

If you love matcha, or if you simply want to experience authentic Japanese tea in its purest form, this is a place you shouldn’t miss. A must-visit.","From the moment I stepped into Phi Selected TEA, I knew I had discovered something special in Chiang Mai. The owner is genuinely passionate and deeply knowledgeable about tea, having lived for 20 years in Japan, he has returned with carefully selected, premium matcha and green teas from Japan, and it shows.

What truly sets this place apart is taking the time to sit and talk with him. He invites you to taste different grades and varieties of matcha, guiding you through flavours and textures so you can discover which one suits your personal palate best. It’s not just a drink, it’s an experience. I learned so much about how subtle differences in cultivation, processing and grade create meaningful distinctions in taste.

Yes, the prices are slightly above average but in my opinion they’re absolutely justified by the quality of the tea and the whole experience. The matcha here is the smoothest and most balanced I’ve ever had no bitterness, just pure umami and sweetness.

If you’re a matcha lover (or even just curious about high-end Japanese tea), this place deserves a stop. Whether you want a quiet contemplative moment, a fun tasting journey or a meaningful souvenir of Chiang Mai, Phi Selected TEA ticks all the boxes.","Amazing owner who opened this shop last November! I had such a great experience with my family. The quality is amazing and they have plenty of options.

I highly recommend for an authentic and lowkey experience. The owner is extremely kind - he designed the shop and additional goodies.

You can buy matcha powder here as well! They have some great options","It’s so good! Must visit! It’s the real deal. Love this place  this is real Matcha people, forget the Starbucks green thing you get the called Matcha -> this is Matcha real authentic from Japan!

Pineapple fried rice, a common dish in Thailand, is yummy and cooked with good Jasmine rice and fresh ingredients. No hypster-ized decor or fancy fusion menu but what is presented on the table is so comforting to the appetite and the soul. Pairing that with a heaven-sent fresh coconut with tender flavourful flesh and refreshingly delicious water, this lunch of 130 baht is  a wonderful first meal in Chiang Mai.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Wonderful stay — stylish, comfortable, and full of charm!

I’ve stayed here twice and loved both visits. The first time was in a Junior Suite on the road side (room #302, if I remember correctly) — super nice, spacious, crisp, and clean. This time I stayed two nights in a Deluxe Room (#203) and loved it just as much.

All the rooms I’ve stayed in are beautifully designed and built with great attention to detail — simple but elegant, high-quality, clean, and very comfortable. It feels like staying at a small boutique hotel somewhere in Europe, with lovely greenery and stylish décor. I especially love the cool artworks from around the world displayed throughout the hotel.

The best part is enjoying breakfast early in the morning in the glass room overlooking the vibrant town — watching locals jogging by the old town moat of Chiang Mai. The hotel’s location is perfect too, just 5–10 minutes from all the nice spots and restaurants.","Close to Old Town and a 7/11.
Rooms were clean and felt ""new"".
Good AC and a SMART TV!
No noise from nearby traffic at all.
Friendly staff, could communicate easily in English.
Very good price/quality ratio.
Would absolutely recommend or stay here again.","Love this hotel. Great for everyone—solo, couple, friends or family. Very clean, comfortable, good vibes, safe, delicious breakfast. We will be back and highly recommend!","I booked a stay at Quu Hotel Chiang Mai from 22nd July to 24th July (2 nights), and unfortunately, our experience was extremely disappointing from the moment we arrived. There was no greeting or assistance from the staff, and we had to rely on our Grab driver to carry our heavy luggage in pouring rain. No one helped open the hotel door, and my wife even suffered a minor hand injury due to the heavy door.

Check-in itself went smoothly, and the room mostly matched the booking website photos, though some angles of the room and bathroom were missing. However, there was no standing shower, only a bathtub, which was inconvenient. The room was also very dusty, and we had to use our own wipes just to make it acceptable.

After discussing with my wife, we decided not to stay and requested a partial refund for one night. The staff directed us to Agoda, who told us that the hotel had to approve it. Despite our clear explanation, the hotel rejected our request and falsely claimed that they had offered us a room change, which never happened.

This hotel is unprofessional, unhelpful, and dishonest. I strongly advise against booking here, save yourself the frustration and disappointment.","Everything here was amazing! For a great price , you get a modern and fresh room, free room cleaning every day, a great location across the street from the old city, great service, and a filling and delicious breakfast."

The Dubai Chocolate was deep and indulgent, with a hint of luxury cocoa and Kunafa. Perfect combo if you like balanced sweetness and real flavor!"

If you’re looking for a calm place with good food and a relaxedmosphere (plus adorable cats), Uncle Kani is definitely worth a visit","A small restaurant that serves delicious food. Very specialised menu. Location is a bit tucked away in a local neighbourhood.

The food is great and cooked perfectly. Portion was a bit small so I would recommend to upgrade the beef and tallow fried rice.

Tables are limited, and they frequenly sell out their menu. So arrive early. Also it is a place to enjoy your meal but not to linger since other people will be waiting for your seat.","lovely place & lovely comfort food! i went here for dinner with my husband & ordered the beef fat fried rice, hashbrown, aus ribeye, peach tea, ginger ale, and the caramel custard thing (shaped heart, so cute). all are tastes nice!

bonus: they had 2 lovely cats hehe. as a cat lover, this is like +10000000 aura! must visit when you are in chiang mai."
ChIJre4JEgA72jARIZX10gc7C9M,CHARLIE (ชาร์ลี) Thai Tea - Nimman Soi13 (Grab&Go),18.7965464,98.96671959999999,4.7,580,2025-03-02,"Came by specifically to try their Thai tea and was genuinely impressed. The quality exceeded expectations, ordered less sweet, with well-balanced flavors that aren’t overly sweet — exactly to our preference. Standout picks were the Charlie (Salted Caramel Cold Foam Pour Over Thai Milk Tea) and the Soft Latte Thai Tea, both smooth, fragrant, and nicely layered. We went with the staff’s recommendations for type of tea and honestly, you can’t go wrong with any of them.

The outlet itself is small and minimal, quite cool inside, with only a handful of chairs available indoors and outdoors. There was no queue when we visited, making it ideal for a quick grab-and-go. Perfect for picking up a drink and strolling around the area. Definitely worth a try if you’re a Thai tea fan. I prefer this outlet compared others.",Cute store with a cozy atmosphere. You get to choose from their selection of tea leaves and if you order in they allow you to mix your own Thai iced tea as well which makes for a great experience! Smooth balance of flavour and if it’s your first time in Thailand then I would suggest getting 50% sugar as I’ve noticed their default sugar level is higher than normal.,"My first time trying this one, in Chiang Mai. The place just simple, prefer for take away. The thai tea really delicious, yummy! Thick, sweet and you can choose kind of tea.","A must-visit for tea lovers, especially if you love Thai tea! They offer a wide variety of teas from different parts of Thailand, and you can customize how dark you want your tea and the sweetness level.

I highly recommend the Satun tea (4 mins, 75% sweetness), it’s rich and flavorful.

They also have a great selection of coffee, but the Thai tea is the real highlight. If you’re a Thai tea fan, this is the place for you!","This staff member at this bubble tea shop is an absolute disgrace to Chiang Mai's service industry. From the moment we started ordering, she was impatient and had a terrible attitude. The drink she made was almost entirely ice — there was less than 80ml of actual liquid in the cup.

When I tried to raise the issue with her, she remained unfriendly and unhelpful. She kept her back turned to us the entire time, completely unwilling to communicate. Another staff member had to step in to talk to us and then relayed our concerns to her. Her response? She couldn’t have cared less and said, “Go ahead and complain about us if you want.”

Absolutely unacceptable behavior and a completely disappointing experience.

I know it's impolite to post someone's photo publicly, but she also showed no respect to us as customers! As a tourist and a foreigner, I don’t understand why she treated us differently. So disappointed!"

I visited with a friend and we ordered their signature green tea, priced at 150 baht. The flavor was rich and well-balanced, with a smooth, deep taste that felt very comforting. It was clear that a lot of care went into the quality of the tea.

The café is also very photogenic—every corner looks great in photos—yet it never feels noisy or crowded. It’s an ideal spot to slow down, enjoy a drink, and spend some quiet time with friends. I truly enjoyed being here and would happily come back again.","The Vanilla Sour beer is to die for: flavorful, crisp, and very refreshing.  The staff are great hosts and the menu features local Thai Cuisine.  A short walk from the Silver Temple or a Tuk-tuk from the airport.  Worth it!",This place is absolutely fantastic. Not only is there coffee amazing but they pass all the vibe checks. Super cool design inside and out and you can just tell they put a lot of creativity into their work. I really appreciate this coffee shop and will be back again for another iced Americano.,Amazing little cafe. Cosy and chill with good coffee and good pricey. Great place to get some work done! All coffee is solid,Very good coffee! Delicious desserts! Excellent service and very nice ambiance. You can seat inside with the air conditioning or outside for the fresh air.

We're back and the food is still top notch! The same staff are still here as well as the delicious food. Do not understand why such low ratings because this , hands down, is THE best place for breakfast/lunch in Chiang Mai! Their fruit is fresh and mounded on your plate. The Raspberry/White Chocolate scones are freshly baked and once they run out, they're gone! The atmosphere is simple yet tasteful. Soft jazzy/contemporary music in the background to add to ambience but nothing overpowering as to disturb a quiet conversation. Their food is edible art! People have complained about the prices and I don't know why. If you tried to find this quality of food and portions, you'd pay twice as much for less quality! DO NOT let the reviews sway you!!! Cone and taste why this is where you should eat!!!","If you ask any real local person they’d say this place is the best place for brunch! Ive been coming here for years and the food + service have always been top notched.

My to go is the parmesan scramble egg because it’s super rich & creamy so much so that it melts in your mouth sometimes. You wouldnt be able to find a better egg than this. Their veggies and tomatoes are fresh & sweet too.

Other bake goods are also nice. Their scones have the half scone half biscuit texture which for me is really addictive haha

Anyway, it’s the most perfect place to start your day in CNX!","Super Fluffy crunchy on the edge pancakes with fresh fruit are a showstopper light sweetness and topped generously with vibrant seasonal fruits.

Perfect if you’re craving something sweet without feeling too heavy.

The scrambled eggs with avocado toast and salmon on the side is a standout. The eggs are soft and creamy, the avocado perfectly ripe, and the smoked salmon adds that extra boost of peanut butter Chocolate protein shake putting a cherry on top.

Zucchini toast is an exquisite menu to try out on a side note.","Tasty dishes with fresh and quality ingredients.

Still one of my reco places for brunch in Chiangmai.

French toast with mixed fruits today was the best!!!","So good I had to come back twice!
Portion was huge, coffee was good, the cats were a nice surprise. Just a cool cafe around the neighbourhood ❤️"

I want to give you 1 star but I don't want to be rude... Recommend You to change this. This is not for sale. Only look good and is big portion. I ordered two boxes and I gonna throw everything to the trash.,"A nice little cafe to take a break from the hot chiang mai weather. Drinks are alright, as for the brownie, we prefer the original  as compare to the cheesecake flavour. Matcha is nice and the jasmine tea is refreshing.",Wow! Stumbled upon this place after we had dinner and I’m so glad I did! Their brownies are so good! Which has been surprisingly hard to find here in Chiang Mai. We will definitely be back. The memorize brownie is amazing,"Gosh, walked in, place was empty, thinking maybe this was a mistake. Ordered the standard memorize brownie anyway. Was warned the brownie takes ten minutes. By the time the brownie was ready, the place was packed. Then I understood: their brownie is outstanding! Warm, slightly gooey structure, with warmed milk cream... Paired with decent cappuccino. This is truly one of the best I ever had. Well done. If you have a sweet tooth and don't give a damn about calories, macro mix... this is heaven.",I love this brownie kit. So far I have only tried the original brownie. The cream is really delicious so is the brownie. It really does taste like it just came out of the oven if you heat it up. I ordered it on delivery in Bangkok and then realized that my Chiang Mai hotel is right next to the store so I went to check that out. I will definitely order another kit.

Never returned again.. but I read their standard might have improved since then.,"Sandwiches are getting smaller by the day!! While being more expensive! Today, my 6"" sandwich was about 4.5"", this is borderline scammy !",The Turkey Breast sub is light but filling. Fresh lettuce and cucumbers make it taste balanced. Great for a healthy lunch.,"Where's the tuna??? Looks like they only put one scoop of tuna (if that) instead of the standard two on a 6"" sub. With that being said, everything else tasted fine.","Love that the staff always check if I want extra veggies or sauce. Makes the experience more personal, and the sandwich tastes just right."

This spot has been my second home for months — not only thanks to their flavorful black coffees, friendly staff, and relaxing outdoor space, but maybe mostly because of Bobby: the sweet, adorable cat you’ll usually find on her favorite chair, often in a yogic position and deep sleep.

You can choose from various blends from around the world. Many are single-origin, with info about the washing process, altitude, and bean type. I preferred the hot Americanos: they’re made so well! A perfect way to really taste the beans and take your time to simmer with your coffee.","☕️All black: Simplicity is the best👍🏻
This tiny hidden coffee shop sells only americano with a selection of local and imported beans. Prices vary from 50 to 100+ baht. I tried their Khun Chang Khian for just 50 baht, and the taste is worth more than its price👍🏻✨","Simply the best coffee spot in Nimman. I love black coffee, and their quality is truly top tier — you can taste the difference. It’s incredibly refreshing in the morning.
My little son also loves playing with the owner’s black cat, who is just as chill as the café vibe.
If black coffee isn’t your thing, you can still order it and add milk at home . I usually drink half straight and turn the rest into an iced latte.","Good coffee, cute cat.

Recommend if you like specialty coffee. The espresso has been well-made both times I've been there, not over- or under-extracted, and they have a good range of beans from around the world.

It's a small place with mostly outdoor seating. There is a discount for to-go drinks if you bring your own cup.","very good selection of speciality coffees.
if you love espresso or long black visit here for wonderful coffee amd service.  it is reasonably price also compared to some other specialty coffee shops nearby"

The space is beautifully curated and thoughtfully detailed, and the location is perfect. The owner is incredibly sweet and welcoming. God is truly in the details here—don’t miss exploring their hotel right next to the café as well. A must-visit!","Me and my husband come here twice a week, and we truly love this coffee shop. It’s the best one open at night, and we always enjoy our visits.

However, today we ordered our usual drinks — the hot chocolate and the almond chocolate — and unfortunately both were disappointing. The cocoa drink was tasteless, and the almond chocolate had very little chocolate flavor. This has never happened before.

As regular customers, we really hope the owner pays attention to this issue because we don’t want to lose such a great place.","You can pick and choose your own beans. The flat white was decent, nothing special. The Thai milk tea was alright. Good place to work! The road outside gets busy and noisy, so while the patio is nice, not very conducive. Nice service staff. Indoor seating is chilly. Pretty expensive drinks for the area.","Something magical about this place because I was mysteriously pulled in while walking past the cafe. ❤️

I knew it was going to be good as soon as I saw the design, the architecture, the old wood, and the coffee bar inside. I was immediately greeted by the manager who was very helpful and informative. I don't usually choose coffee bars, but this one is special. After 5 minutes of learning about their slow drip process and the different coffees they offered, I chose the Ethiopian bean.

They take their time and bring you what you need to enjoy the coffee. The Ethiopian blend was amazing. Exactly as described. I drank it without any sugar or cream. I had to have the chocolate croissant.

The seating is comfortable. The atmosphere is relaxing and great for meetings, couples, or by yourself. You don't hear a lot of street noise if you sit inside. I can tell that it would be fun to sit outside in the evenings when it's cooler and you can watch people walk by.

I definitely found a great cafe and will come back. I highly recommend this place if you are picky about coffee and want to experience something different than your average coffee shop. The cost is worth the visit. You are paying for quality and ambience as well as for great service.","Coffee is good, they made us fast &delicious .
But oh well, came to have a breakfast with literally Noone in cafee besides us . How you can  cook scramble eggs for 45 minutes ?? Was already thinking to leave and get food from 7/11 ... rather than waiting for sooo long for simple scrambled eggs with toast and they didn't make a toast in the end ... I belled on a bell they have for 2 minutes before someone came out to talk to me"

Whether it's an iced drink or hot drink, she makes it with as much attention to detail and gives a full cup. Very nice person. For the hot coffee, she makes a pretty latte art. And the drinks are very good price. Like 25 baht for a hot latte, 35 baht for cold. She's truly professional.","The BEST coffee and smoothies in this city 🥳🥳🥳🥰

I hope she opens a large indoor cafe one day, especially because she supports many local vendors by selling their goods at her cafe: The crochet drink holders, the muffins, the sandwiches, and other things are from several ladies in the neighborhood ✨

The Spirited Away pot was a farewell gift. That's how much I loved going to this cafe every day ❤️",Love this coffee spot! We come here for coffee and drinks almost every other day!,"This is the best Matcha Latte I’ve ever had! I used to drink Thai Tea and Espresso as well, and they’re also some of the best drinks I’ve had here. My husband and I usually get our drinks from Pui Coffee every day. If you go after 1 PM, be prepared for a long wait—there are so many customers around that time. I once waited about an hour and a half just for two drinks, but it was absolutely worth it.

I love beef soup and fried rice with garlic. Both menu are excellent more than I can say!
The restaurant have quite less seating. I think I may suggest you had better call to make a reservation in advance.
In totally I like this restaurant.","One of my most favorite restaurants to go to in Chiang Mai. The beef is so tender and delicious. The pasta was also very good and so was the mango cheesecake. So to sum it up, everything on the menu was great! The price is pretty high but it is really worth it.",Very nice authentic Japanese food.

We were so impressed by the food and the vibe at Rainy's Veggie Burgers that we simply had to come back the next day. This place is a true gem. The burgers are simple yet incredibly flavorful, with the patties being clearly homemade with love and care. It's the perfect, no-frills spot for a delicious and very affordable meal. The atmosphere is so cozy and welcoming, and Rainy herself is just the kindest and friendliest owner. This isn't just a place to eat—it feels like you're being welcomed into a friend's home. We're already looking forward to our next visit!","This was our first meal in the city and definitely one of the best. We had Khao Suey Burger,Khaprao Sauce burger, Green Thai Sauce Sphagetti,French Fries and Blue Pea Lime juice. Khaprao sauce and Green Thai were spicy but tasty. We even packed two patties for later. This is definitely recommended for vegetarians, vegans around one nimman area. This shop is run by Rainy, a wonderful and friendly person to converse with.","Rainy is doing such an amazing job with her business so it's not a surprise that her average score here is 5! The burgers and fries are really tasty plus I recommend to go for the butterfly lime juice, it's delicious! However, beside food, Rainy puts so much effort into making her guests to feel like they are at home that I honestly can't remember the last time I had such a pleasant experience when visiting a restaurant. On top of it all, the pricw of the food is very affordable and if you leave the tip, Rainy will make sure it gets donated to the nearest hospital.
Big love from Sinisa and Dragan, we will come back to Chiang Mai next year just to visit Rainy and taste some of the finest veggie burgers in Thailand.","This little outdoor but covered restaurant in the Nimman neighborhood run by super sweet Rainy/Fon has really tasty fusion burgers and pasta.

Everything is apparently vegan except the buns (which unfortunately contain eggs; I urged her to find vegan buns).","Great burgers, Rainy is very friendly, we felt welcome and comfortable. The food was unique, blending traditional Thai flavours to a modern vegetarian burger."

There are not only Korean books, but also books in English, Chinese, and Thai, so it's incredibly diverse.
There's a separate children's area, which moms like me are simply grateful for.","The annual fee is cheap, so it is more economical than studying at a cafe.

My first impression was the wide selection of teas and their different brewing methods. I hadn't thought about the variety and brewing methods of tea (I thought they only had coffee). But learning about the different types of tea, their aromas, and the brewing techniques was a real eye-opener. I chose Surat Thani tea, steeped for 5 minutes, with 25% sweetness.

Make sure you finish every single drop before you leave.

The barista here is better than SG one in general. Taste the coffee and you’ll know.

My brother in law ordered the cigaretto and he said it’s nice. You can try it if you want.

If you duno what is what, the menu has the coffee description.

One thing I really kennut is the barista face is way too near to my coffee -.-
Almost breathing into it when doing yo my order: As shown in photo. But whatever.

You can get coffee beans here as well. Haven’t tried it but you can ask the staff for recommendations.

You can even request to smell the beans before getting it.

Atmosphere is just meh, normal cafe nothing special. Enjoy the coffee and move to next cafe.","With many cafes in Nimman to choose from, Ristr8to has become a firm favourite of mine. I’ve become partial to a Cortado and have to admit I’ve never been let down here. Smooth and strong its made with care and attention. With wonderfully friendly staff, it’s nice to have somewhere I can call my local cafe. There’s a lovely ambiance that allows one to sit back, drink nice coffee and let the world drift by. Based on my own experience I can recommend Rist8to.","There are coffees you drink, and then there are coffees that slow you down.
Ristr8to is firmly in the second category.
The cappuccino here is exceptional — beautifully balanced, with a creamy, velvety texture and a depth that tells you the beans have been treated with real respect. The roast leans toward the complex rather than the aggressive: rich chocolate notes, a gentle nuttiness, and a clean finish with just enough acidity to keep things lively, not sharp. You can taste that this is coffee made by people who obsess over details — in the best possible way.
What really elevates the experience, though, is the vibe. Sitting here in Nimman, you’re surrounded by a mix of young locals, creatives, digital nomads, and curious travelers. There’s a quiet energy to the place — laptops open, conversations flowing, tourists pausing mid-walk for “just one more coffee.” It’s the kind of café where you don’t feel rushed, and you don’t feel invisible either.
I found myself doing what this place seems designed for: sitting still, coffee in hand, watching the world pass by. Traffic, footsteps, snippets of languages, sunlight shifting across tables — all of it framed by a damn good cup of coffee.
Some cafés are about caffeine.
This one is about presence.
If you’re in Nimman and you care about coffee — really care — this is not optional. ☕",Extensive menu with almost every variety of coffee you can imagine. Tried some of the popular favorite and agree that the coffee is good. Pretty chill ambience with both indoor and outdoor seating. They do have a few food options like waffles but wish there was more. Place only accepts cash.,"I first visited this place 9 years ago, and I’m amazed that they’ve managed to maintain the exact same high standards.

The staff were very friendly and welcoming, making the atmosphere feel relaxed and comfortable from the moment I walked in. Their service was attentive and warm, which made the visit even more enjoyable.

The drinks were really good — well-balanced, refreshing, and nicely presented. You can tell they put care into both the quality and the details.

Overall, it’s a lovely place to chill, enjoy good drinks, and experience friendly service. I would definitely come back again! 😊","A much overrated place.

I first tried their cloud latte (130baht). It was simply an iced latte made from decent doi Chang coffee bean, with a low-quality coconut ice cream on top. And both elements had zero synergy in flavors.

Later i decided it to give it a second try since it features quite a few very interesting beans. I ordered a passion-fruit-fermented black (120baht). As opposed to most fruit-enzyme-processed bean which taste exceptionally fruity and characteristic of the fruit used, it was average at best.

And the barista in the afternoon and night gave me different info about their coffee, which is not a sign of well-trained staff.

At a higher-end price in Chiang Mai, this does not meet the cut.","The coffee was delicious, and the cake was equally good! Perhaps it’s popular because the place is showing signs of wear and tear. I’d love to return for the coffee.","This coffee shop demonstrates a clear commitment to exceptional coffee brewing and minimal space design. It has attracted a significant number of patrons, both local and international, and benefits from its proximity to the prominent and bustling Nimmanhaemin Road. However, a notable concern arises regarding the placement of the designated smoking area, which is situated near the public pavement. The proximity of this area allows cigarette smoke to disperse, potentially affecting pedestrians and motorcyclists passing by. I urge the owner of this establishment to consider their social responsibility in this matter, as the current arrangement may negatively impact the health of others. While the coffee quality is commendable, individuals prioritizing social responsibility may wish to re-evaluate their patronage of this establishment.","I had a flat white with oat milk take away - great coffee, good vibes of the cafe. I didn't get a chance to chill at the cafe, but it looked good, modern and reasonably priced. My coffee was 80 plus 20 for oat milk. They didn't have any vegan foods/bakery to offer which was a con, but good overall."

But the matcha madeleine was great. Moist and too sweet.,"One of my top cafe experiences in Chiangmai. They also have a super cute shop cat (Messi who is super sweet and friendly), and the cafe is separated into a sitting area and a store area. The cafe sells various trinkets including mother of pearl jewellery and ceramic or glass home goods including little spoons. They also sell home fragrances!

Our drinks were good - Americano was really great (note that hey have no decaf - which seems to be common in Chiang Mai). The strawberry latte was really good and they let me change to oat milk but I’d say it was a little too sweet for me. Still, very much worth going!","Highly recommend the cinnamon roll! Its one of the best i have had. Not too sweet, fragrant cinnamon and texture is unlike those fluffy rolls, its abit more densed. The tiramisu is very good as well! Would recommend."

It’s the kind of café where you just naturally slow down and enjoy your meal.

We tried a few dishes and everything was beautifully plated and full of flavour:

Smoked Salmon & Eggs Toast
The toast was soft and buttery, topped with generous slices of fresh salmon and perfectly runny eggs. The mix of pickles, tomatoes, and passionfruit on the side added a bright, refreshing balance. Loved how satisfying yet light it was.

Thai Beef Salad
A colourful bowl with tender slices of beef, sweet oranges, juicy tomatoes, red onions, and a nice kick from fresh chili. It’s refreshing with a nice balance of sweet, tangy, and mildly spicy — great for brunch or a hot day.

Besides the food, the café also has a small curated retail corner with skincare and lifestyle products, adding a boutique feel to the place. It’s a lovely spot for brunch, a slow afternoon coffee, or even just to chill and enjoy the aesthetic environment.

It’s a small space but very well located in the middle of Nimman. A great spot to stop by, refresh and just enjoy the vibe.","I came to Klay Cafe for breakfast because I wanted something healthy, well-priced and delicious. I got the colorful tropical smoothie bowl which was perfectly balanced in taste and texture. Sometimes bowls can be too sweet, too runny, or sometimes - too cold. This one was just right. However, the tropical bowl wasn’t the highlight…it was the coffee. I had one of the best flat whites I’ve ever had. It was silky - like sipping a coffee liqueur without the alcohol or overwhelming sweetness. I’ll definitely be back to try some other things on the menu.",The best breakfast we had in Chiang Mai. I think the pictures speak for themselves but they have a great range of dishes in a beautiful setting. The service is slightly slow but it doesn’t take away from the food and the atmosphere. Great coffee and French toast!,"I’d heard several people recommend this place, so I had to check it out, and I honestly don’t understand the hype.

The place was packed, and we ended up sharing a table with three different people during our time there. The chairs and table were wobbly, and even the slightest movement shook the whole table and almost spilled the drink. The food took ages to arrive.
The food itself was fine - nothing amazing, nothing terrible.

The good parts? The prices are good, the staff is very friendly, and they clear tables quickly."

How to Get There:
Find the building entrance on Nimmanhaemin Soi 5. Look for the small elevator or take the stairs up to the 5th floor. It’s worth the short, hidden journey for the incredible view and quality brew.

At that time, they were using a blend of Brazilian, Thai, and Ethiopian beans, and the coffee was truly delicious.

The flavor was rich, the temperature was perfectly managed—not too hot and not too cold, just right for a good latte—and it was really smooth. Inside, the atmosphere is very minimalist. I don’t think it’s very suitable for working on a laptop, as the tables are quite low and small. But it’s definitely a nice spot to chill.

Every time I visit, I try to discover a new favorite, though I have to admit that most of the flavors are quite sweet for my personal taste since I don’t eat much sugar. However, my company — whether my friend or boyfriend — always enjoys them a lot, so it’s a great spot to share something sweet together.

The shop provides free drinking water, which I find very thoughtful, especially after eating gelato. The staff are a bit shy but always kind, polite, and ready to help. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet, perfect for sitting down to enjoy a slow afternoon in Chiang Mai.

The location is convenient but not ideal for car parking since the street is quite small; however, it’s easy to park a motorbike nearby. I usually order one or two scoops each visit.

I was hoping to try the famous ricotta and caramelized fig but they had sold out. I had the ricotta and pear instead, which was excellent, as was the strawberry cheesecake.

I have edited this post several times, as I visit the café daily and try a different coffee each time. Today, I tried the Sompetch with orange, and it was excellent",Good and fancy coffee shop. There are several Graph coffee shops in Chiang Mai. I only visited this one. I tried the coffee and bought some beans to take home. We also bought some cute cups. Unfortunately we just had breakfast before. There was no room for pastries. But they surely look good! Next time for sure.,"Graph Ground is one of those cafés that makes you stop at the door and go, “Okay, this place knows what it’s doing.”*It’s industrial-modern in the best possible way — dark tones, concrete and metal textures, clean lines, and a quiet, creative atmosphere. It feels like the meeting point of urban coffee culture and Chiang Mai craftsmanship, and it pulls that identity off perfectly.

What I Tried

Wildweekend Seasonal Blend
Local Chiang Mai beans with:

* Tropical fruit acidity
* Bergamot notes
* A yogurt-like tang
* Sweet, clean finish

Aromatic, slightly fermented in character, beautifully balanced. One of those coffees where you keep smelling the cup between sips.

Breaking Brown (Espresso Cold Brew + Almond Milk)

* Smooth but deep espresso flavor
* Almond milk adding natural sweetness
* Very “third-wave Chiang Mai”

Honestly, this one surprised me the most — soft, layered, and extremely easy to drink. A comfort coffee but with personality.

Overall Experience

Graph Ground was the perfect choice for today. Calm, design-focused, and serious about its coffee. It captures Chiang Mai’s modern side in such a clean, stylish way that sitting here instantly puts you in a good headspace.","Service - 4.5 stars

Seaweed coffee cocktail - 4.5 stars
The seaweed was fragrant and the savoury umami flavour balanced the coffee well. I'm not usually a fan of coffee cocktails but this was well done!

6oz white
Khun chang kian - 4 stars

Huay chom phu - 4 stars

Both were pretty delicate. No obvious notes in the white coffees. Reliable WiFi and clean bathroom.","Recently, the quality of coffee in northern Thailand has dramatically improved, and Thai coffee beans also have a distinct flavor. There are many good cafes in town, and this cafe is one of them. If you like coffee, you’ll like this cafe. They’re serious about the coffee they serve."

I saw from the outside something which hyped me really up: „free range eggs“, and you can taste that these chickens actually got some sunlight and could enjoy life.
Besides that they look for their ingredients, real cheese, real meat, real eggs,… their staff is super friendly and kind.
The food was also very good. You can create your own „breakfast“ which is pretty convenient.

We had both the regular and beef Benedict’s along with a healthy vegetable and fruit smoothie. You could tell everything was made with high quality ingredients and the smoothie tasted very good. The Benedict’s both tasted really good, but not mind-blowing. Price is a bit higher than other spots.","I was wandering around Nimman  and saw the pulled pork on their menu and knew I had to stop in to try it. I’ve been in Thailand for 6 weeks and was missing some of my favorite foods from the states. This meal did not disappoint! The pork was on a mini hot skillet still sizzling when it came to the table. The presentation was lovely. The pork had a light sauce on it and just a tiny bit spicy. The toast was warm and perfect! So tasty!! Aroi maak maak! I think this was one of  my favorite Meals I’ve had in Thailand  so far, in that it gave me a taste of home but with the high level of quality and presentation the Thais are known for. Highly recommend.","Good cafe for all day breakfast & they also served some german food, some local beers & all of it looks good but I don't try it. I came only in the morning for breakfast.

The atmosphere? Laid-back, friendly and comfortable. The team genuinely cares about what they serve, you can see they’ve put real effort into sourcing clean ingredients, and the mood is just easy-going and welcoming.  ￼

We tried the classic croissant and the matcha strawberry croissant, both served warm with a perfectly flaky, buttery crust. The matcha strawberry croissant really stood out. We enjoyed the tartness of the strawberry paired beautifully with the slightly bitter matcha. It was a well balanced and unique combination.

I also ordered a cappuccino with oat milk, and it was creamy, smooth, and generously sized, which I really appreciated. It is a bit on the pricier side, my cappuccino with oat milk came out to 110 baht, but honestly, it was delightful and worth it.

The atmosphere is very inviting, with soothing music and an amazing pastry selection. There were so many options that it was hard to limit ourselves to just two. Overall, this is a must-stop for a quality cappuccino with oat milk and a great pastry when you’re in the area.","Such a cozy place! The staff is lovely, the coffee is great, and the selection of desserts is so huge that it’ll take you forever to choose. We tried the croissant, the lemon tart, and the strawberry cream cake in a container — everything was absolutely delicious!

We had the best experience eating at this quaint cafe. The pastries are light and delightful and not too sweet — very French! And beautifully decorated. The staff were very friendly  too. The cafe offers indoor and outdoor seating, and believe it or not there’s parking for cars one block away. As we were leaving we spotted the certificate from Le Cordon Bleu on the wall, which explains the craft and quality of both food and atmosphere.","Nice cafe offering a large selection of bakery, hot food, and hot/cold drinks. Seating outdoors and indoors with a beautiful Christmas display at the front. Attentive staff with items thoughtfully packaged for take-out. Crepe layer cake and coconut cake was delicious; will definitely be back and try their other offerings in the future.","It becomes one of my favorite patisseries in Chiang Mai as it’s baked perfectly with great ingredients and smells so good.

I'm usually not a fan of expensive ""Instagram cafes"", but this one is worth the price tag!
They have a wiiiiide variety of different teas (including green tea, red tear, black tea, Cylon etc) all regionally sourced within Thailand.

They also have a ton of super nice looking and even more delicious Thai tea creation! You'll chosose yiur own tea, vrewing time and sweetness. Really worth testing it out

Unfortunately, they do not offer non-dairy milk options (no oat, almond or other plant based  milk), otherwise this would have been an easy 5 stars for me","Cute cafe in the Nimman neighbourhood that serves up incredible Thai milk teas.
They have the option to customise which tea (which you can also smell before you order), sweetness level and brew time to decide how intense the tea flavour is.
We went with the servers recommendations and opted for the OG and the Charlie with the Chiang Rai Gold and Songkhla tea options. 50% sweetness was more than enough for us (probably would choose 25% sweetness in the future). Would highly recommend both drinks as a cute relaxing cafe date.","This is the best Thai tea I’ve had in Thailand so far! When you order the Soft Latte Thai Tea, you can choose the type of tea leaves you want, which makes it even better. The tea aroma comes through gently in the drink, and it tastes amazing. I also added an espresso shot to the Mint Choco Latte, and it was incredibly good too! If you’re a mint-choco lover, I highly recommend it!","The best Thai tea I've ever had. My favourite is OG, and you can choose the tea you like. I tried some and all of them are amazing!","Such a great find!
This Thai milk tea shop uses no artificial coloring, and the tea still looks beautiful and tastes amazing.

A hostel and coffee shop combined - something you see quite often in Nimman, and very convenient. They offer a good selection of different coffee roasts and also sell beans to take home. I tried one of the pastries as well and really enjoyed it.

There’s seating both indoors and outdoors, with the outdoor area being my clear preference. The atmosphere inside feels a bit stiff, but overall it’s a nice spot for good coffee and a relaxed break.","Walked into this cafe and instantly felt like I stepped into a dream. The all-white theme is surreal and calming, perfect for both relaxing and working. I had the English breakfast, which was genuinely authentic and satisfying, followed by a cappuccino and an espresso shot both were spot on.

I spent around 3–5 hours upstairs working and the vibe was quiet, peaceful, and very Instagrammable. Though the Wi-Fi lagged a bit at times, the overall experience was still excellent. Would totally come back for the aesthetic, the food, and the chill atmosphere.","I come here almost every day. Work gets done very efficiently, and the staff are extremely kind and thoughtful.
The Wi-Fi connection is stable, and the white-themed décor gives it a stylish feel.
The entrance has a distinctly Japanese aesthetic, and the matcha is served in the traditional Japanese style, making it feel as though I’m in Japan.","Beautiful Spot, Disappointing Food Quality

I visited today with a friend after high recommendations, and while the venue is absolutely beautiful and highly photogenic, the food was a big letdown.
Our items were stale and tasted old. My friend’s scone was dry and crumbling. My House Roti was mainly whipped cream and didn't taste fresh. The quality was far below cheaper street food options. We left both plates unfinished.
Sadly, I won't be returning unless the quality of the pastries and desserts drastically improves","Review the café, not the hotel.
Food itself was quite good overall.
Staff can improve in the service itself though and even make a buck out of it. Adapting small things that are not on the menu won't hurt really"

I ordered the coconut coffee and it was surprisingly good! My friend tried the Thai-espresso and it was also very nice and flavorful.

Even though the café is right by the main street and there’s a bit of noise, you can still talk comfortably — though it might be more suitable for a quick grab-and-go. Overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely come back again!","Nice little coffee pop up shop.
Its always pretty full, i mean you have 4 seats, and yes they are likely to be full.
Still a great little cafe especially if you just want to to grab to go.
Only minus, it is a bit pricey in my opinion for such a small place.","Seriously loved this spot! Got the Americano (medium and dark roasts) and the coffee was so good, legit flavor and perfect for a quick boost.

The staff super friendly and welcoming.

It's a small coffee stand but they have a nice little chill area out front. Great vibes for a quick break.

PS. You'll have to find street parking, so plan accordingly.","The taste is good, and I like the slightly heavy texture of the latte.

I would say this place is suited for those who want to take well-lit instagram photos, and maybe coffee snobs (I am not equipped to assess if their coffee is high quality enough to justify the price), but definitely not for hanging out or getting work done. Chairs on the second floor are mostly little stools, very uncomfortable, and as far as I can tell, there are no outlets.

It feels a bit odd sitting inside. Maybe just because I was by myself when I came here. And it was super quiet. But prices are fair and the guy who worked here was very nice. And I liked the lemon tart.,"We came here specifically for the pistachio tart, and left highly satisfied. While it's on the pricier side for its size, we found that the quality of the flavor was worth it. The flavor is rich and you can take your time to savor it.

As for the drinks, the cheese cream strawberry latte was really, really good too. It tastes like a strawberry shortcake in liquid form and had real chunks of strawberry. The coffee was just okay for me, but it worked well as a palate cleanser to help appreciate the sweetness of the tart.

For an upscale dessert, Krema is an absolute yes.","Absolutely lovely café with a calm, elegant atmosphere. The desserts are beautifully presented and taste just as amazing as they look—fresh, well-balanced, and not overly sweet. The coffee is smooth and perfectly crafted, making it a great pairing with the pastries. I really enjoyed the cozy, minimalist décor; it’s a perfect spot to relax, catch up with friends, or enjoy some quiet time. Friendly service and great attention to detail. Highly recommended!","This place is so good. I highly recommend the treats here, not too sweet and so fresh, but for the coffee a bit too light for me anyway, I can't wait to go back and try so many other treats",Such a cool little cafe with almost dessert-like coffees.

The café is easy to find and has a friendly, relaxed feeling when you walk in.

Plenty of table and space, which is simple and cozy, with indoor and outdoor seating. It is a good place to sit with friends, study, or enjoy some quiet time alone.

I ordered a 100% craft chocolate that cost 128 THB. The drink was served hot with a smooth and creamy texture and no sugar added, so I could really taste the pure chocolate flavor. It was rich, warm, and comforting, and I felt it was a high-quality chocolate drink.

The café also served the drink with a cookie and a cup of hot tea, which made the experience even better. The cookie was soft and sweet, and the hot tea balanced the strong chocolate taste nicely. But if you don't like pure chocolate they also offer a light chocolate as well.

The staff were polite and served everything with care. They explained the menu and made sure my order was just right. The prices are ok compared to the quality of the chocolate and the nice service make it worth it. (THB100-130)

Overall, Kanvela Craft Chocolate Cafe is a great place for chocolate lovers who want a special, delicious drink and a quiet place to relax.",Great products. Been in love with their multiple choices of products and flavour since I visited the branch in Bangkok. Really spacious here. Much bigger and quieter than Bkk with some parking spaces. Same quality of chocolate. Good standards.,"As a big admirer of Kanvela and its amazing chocolate i visited that place. The pralines were amazing, especially the mulled wine. As a chocolate maker from Switzerland i have to say this chocolate is absolutely my favourite one in Thailand, the quality is on its top also the story behind it. Definitely come back and if someone want a really amazing hot chocolate which is absolutely outstanding in Thailand you have to visit here","Delicious chocolates and drinks, beautiful interior, and wonderful service! The guava with chile and salt was some of the best chocolate I have ever tasted. I also tried the taro and coconut, macadamia and biscoff, and green apple - all were gorgeously decorated and sinfully sweet. They have a nice selection of drinks ranging from hot chocolates (using their chocolates, of course) to coffees and teas to juices. There are also many packaged goods that make great gifts for others, or snacks for yourself later! You can sample the chocolate bars, and I loved the strong strawberry flavor of the white chocolate and strawberry bar. There are many other unique chocolate flavors as well, like cereal milk, honey, and some local blends. The women working today were so kind and helpful with their recommendations. I enjoyed my experience sitting among their large plants and savoring each bite or sip of decadent chocolate! If you are on the fence about visiting, let this be your sign to go!","Drinks were not up to our expectation and chocolate was on the light rather than rich side. All drinks were served in plastic glasses. Would be nice if reusable glasses can be used for dine-in. The café is spacious, decor is nice and it is relatively quiet."

He uses manual devices, so your coffee can take time. Hence the concept – slow bar. The quality of coffee that comes out of it is top-notch.

I ordered the special dirty coffee. More than the taste (which was great), I loved seeing him prepare it.

It's a small cafe with only about four small tables. And the WiFi isn't great either. So it's not meant for coworking but rather enjoying the coffee over conversations.

My only complaint is with the menu design. It's ridiculously tough to read anything on it. As a designer, I'd be happy to help him out with it."

Owner is very nice too.
You can buy to take away or you can sit at the store to drink.","Best value take out coffee in this area only 35thb for any coffee including cappuccino or latte and many more. You get to choose the roast level of the bean and the process looks professional as well. There are some small seats, but it’s better to get a to go here.","Great coffee at a decent price with friendly service! This air conditioned cafe has 3 coffee strengths to choose from (light, medium, strong) and offers interesting coffee combinations. For example, the lychee coffee was yummy, as the sweet lychee flavor blended well with the slightly acidic notes of the coffee.","Amazing coffee for a great price, lovely kind service, and rad music.

It was a very confusing experience. We did not see any signs about ordering time so I'm not sure what's the rule here.

The entrance is a bit easy to miss since you have to go inside the G Nimman Hotel, but once you find it, it’s totally worth it.

It’s a small space with mostly stool and bar-top seating, but it’s comfortable and nicely air-conditioned. They also have fast Wi-Fi, which makes it a solid spot to sit and enjoy your food.

I tried their orange espresso and really liked it… refreshing and different in a good way. For food, I ordered the sausage and egg sandwich and everything tasted amazing. The bagel was perfectly chewy and fresh, and the flavors all worked really well together.

They also have a ton of specialty bagel options, so I’m definitely coming back to try more next time I’m in the area. If you’re looking for a great bagel sandwich in Nimman, I highly recommend this place.","Not kettle boiled = not a true bagel in my books. 😐

They do hand-roll and bake them fresh, which helps, but only if you eat them right there while they’re hot. Because once they cool down, it’s basically a savory bread donut that’s lost its will to live. 😅

Takeaway or delivery ends up a bit dense and bready rather than chewy, like bread that got tired halfway through trying to be a bagel.

If you’ve had a proper kettle-boiled bagel, the difference is obvious. It’s like upgrading from instant coffee to a decent café brew.

As a regular “bread roll with a hole,” the taste is great though. But compared to a real New York style bagel, nowhere close. As for the black Truffle  cream cheese, I didn’t taste Truffle at all 🤔 Tasted like regular cream cheese, which was good too, but sadly no truffle taste.

And for the price, I don’t think it’s worth it. Unless you enjoy paying premium prices for bagel cosplay. 🙈

I rated it 4 overall, 5 for the great service and Atmosphere. 3 for the food itself.","Amazing variety of bagels. Good flavour. Coffee was nice. Atmosphere is minimalist, Nordic, clean. Nice with the glass looking out to the pool.
It’s not cheap however, a smoked salmon bagel with extra egg and coffee was almost 400 THB!!","Amazing find! Volks Bagels offers the best homemade bagels in the area. The variety of flavors is fantastic and they taste incredibly fresh. The staff is lovely and the atmosphere is great. Highly recommended for a delicious breakfast or lunch!""","The bagel is good, especially the crispy onion bagel, like it, will come back.

The accommodations were simple but totally fine. My sheets were clean, no hair, and the bed was comfortable enough. The room did get a little warm, but that’s just part of sharing a dorm with other people, not the hostel’s fault.

What really stood out was the front desk. Super helpful every time I asked for assistance. They even made calls for me and helped confirm my pickup for an elephant sanctuary reservation I had. They really go out of their way to make sure things run smoothly for you.

Overall, great value, clean stay, and genuinely kind staff. I’d definitely stay here again.","Overall a pleasant stay. The rooms were ok, you get what you pay for. Cleanliness was very good, the maids would clean and disinfect the rooms and bathroom every day. Mai who was at the front desk goes above and beyond. She’s so bubbly, positive and friendly a real refreshing ray of light. Unfortunately, the boy who’s there “Puu” is miserable and rude. Extremely rude and unhelpful. All he does is sit play his games and look at you like you’ve asked him for a kidney if you require any assistance. Not what I want to be seeing during my travels this negative energy. But it’s okay because Mai countered it. I would stay here again I liked the vibe, the rooms and the location. Rent a ped though as it’s way easier to get around","Stayed at Cozy Owls for 1 month in their Double Deluxe Studio. It was perfect. The room is new and spacious. There’s a little balcony to chill.

It’s in a very quiet location, but very close to everything you need (restaurants/supermarket, etc).","Cozy Owls Chiang Mai is an excellent choice for budget-conscious travelers and long-term visitors, offering a combination of hostel and apartment-style living. Guests consistently praise its exceptional cleanliness—it’s often noted as one of the cleanest hostels in the area. The rooms and private accommodations (which sometimes feature balconies with mountain views) are modern and comfortable, providing good value for money.
The staff are frequently highlighted as friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the local area, enhancing the overall welcoming atmosphere. While the location is a short distance from the Old City, it's conveniently close to local markets like Chang Puak and accessible by local transport.","Room 301 – Terrible experience
There was a strong smell coming from the bathroom, hair on the bed and floor, and dirty marks in the bathroom. The sheets and pillows were also dirty and had hair on them. It was impossible to sleep with those bad odors. When I spoke with the manager, she said it was the guest’s fault and claimed the room was fine, but she refused to come and check the room herself to see how dirty and smelly it really was.

Beautiful drinks, and the strawberry cake had a wonderful soft, plush crumb and a frosting that wasn't too sweet or overpowering. No need for sweetener in the hot coffee (unless you enjoy sweet coffee, no judgment!) because there's no unpleasant bitterness to be found, nor is it a sour shot. Very balanced. My favourite iced drink--and I tried several, for science!--was the coffee and fresh orange juice, which is seasonal. Presentation is perfection, and by this I mean that not only is it aesthetically charming with the cups and stickers, but they even open a tab on the iced drink lid for smooth, easy straw insertion. It's not necessary, but I deeply appreciate that level of thoughtful attention to detail. Cafe is mostly quiet, comfortably air conditioned (and there's an air purifier)--perfect place to read, journal, and write letters. Or bring a friend!

Their coffee is really aromatic, smooth and strong enough to perk you up. I had the orange Americano—the coffee is quite intense, but it is to my liking. If you prefer something lighter, you can actually ask them to adjust with less coffee and more fresh orange juice—they’re happy to tweak it for your taste.

The raisin Danish puff pastry was nicely done—crispy outside, soft inside, not too sweet, just right.

But the one that really stood out was the coconut cake. Super soft, moist, and topped with a thick layer of coconut cream with actual coconut flesh inside. It’s rich but not jelak—seriously good!

The cafe itself is cozy and comfortable, perfect spot to chill. I think travellers will find this place worth visiting, especially with their unique drinks and dessert options. Highly recommend trying the ones I mentioned!","Best matcha and americano coconut in town

That's pretty cool 😎","Our favorite café in all of Chiang Mai – and probably all of Thailand! 😊

We first visited in April 2024 and loved it so much that we made sure to come back in January 2025.

Don makes the best drinks, and we have so many favorites: - Cappuccino (hot & cold) – perfect every time - Thai Milk Tea – richer and more flavorful than most places, hence the darker color  - Green Tea – made with high-quality tea, you can really taste the difference - Thai Tea Lemon – not on the menu, but Don made it for us, and wow, it was THE BEST - Honey Lemon Soda – so refreshing!

We worked from the café every day, and Don always greeted us with a warm smile – it really felt like home. We’ll miss this place so much in the coming months but can’t wait to come back for more of Don’s amazing creations.

Highly recommend it to anyone in Chiang Mai!",Nice newly opened cafe with a few good tables and chairs. I tried ice americano and it was good and the guy was nice. You can choose either dark or medium roast here.

ChIJ2czzHrc62jAR1c3x8aQBSzk,Natwat Home Café,18.7995,99.0042994,4.6,535,2024-11-04,"Subject: From Consistency to Uncertainty: An Open Letter to Natwat Home Café from a Loyal Patron
To the Management of Natwat Home Café,
I am writing this letter to express my profound disappointment regarding an incident that occurred at your café on January 2, 2026, at 8:57 am. As a loyal customer who has consistently supported and trusted your establishment since 2024, today’s experience was deeply upsetting and, quite frankly, embarrassing.
What I encountered this morning was not merely a refusal to allow my dog into the air-conditioned zone; it was a total failure of professional communication. I have attached several photos from my previous visits throughout 2024 and 2025 as evidence that, for nearly two years, your café’s policy has allowed well-behaved pets in the indoor area. My dog has always been welcomed and has strictly followed all house rules.
Today’s incident raises several concerning questions regarding your brand’s standards:
Professional Problem Solving: The staff member informed me that I could not stay inside because of their personal ""pet fur allergy."" In a self-proclaimed ""Pet-Friendly"" establishment, I find it unprofessional that internal staffing issues were shifted onto a loyal customer. A professional solution would have been to have another staff member attend to our table, rather than forcing a regular patron to leave the premises.
Public Embarrassment and Lack of Decorum: The staff chose to confront and reject me loudly in front of other guests. This created a highly negative atmosphere, making me and my pet look ""disrespectful"" in the eyes of others. Consequently, a neighboring table (foreign tourists) misunderstood the situation and asked me to leave. Being ""shamed"" in public due to a staff member's communication style is the most distressing experience I have ever had at a supposedly professional café.
Inconsistent Policy: Claiming to be a ""new staff member who doesn't know the rules"" is not a valid excuse for compromising the service standards that a regular customer has relied on for years. If a policy has changed, there should be clear signage or a polite notification upon entry—not a confrontation in the middle of a meal.
The attached photos prove that I am a customer who loves and has long supported your business, and that my dog is calm and disciplined enough to share a space with others. Today's experience has severely damaged the image of Natwat Home Café that I once admired.
I hope this feedback encourages you to re-evaluate your staff training and internal management. I trust that you will take steps to ensure that no other ""pet-loving family"" has to endure such an embarrassing and exclusionary experience again.
With deep disappointment,
Ricky T.
Loyal Customer (2024 – Present) with documented history","For a small café, Natwat does not feel crowded, the ambience is very calm and inviting. Our service was wonderful, with those little touches of noticing us right when we walked in and suggesting alternatives to things they were out of. They get all of the little touches right. Lovely seating inside or outside in the garden area.","Huge servings, delicious food, reasonable prices, nice ambience, great service.","Delicious food, I really recommend to try the breakfast quesadilla 🤤
Coffee also is very good and stuff is super friendly.","Outstanding food! The best coffee I've had in Chiang Mai so far. Will be coming back.

She was fun to talk to and gave great coffee recommendations. She's got what she likes and can suggest whatever flavor profile you prefer. Definitely stop by! Come for coffee and pizza at this ""guerrilla"" shop. The owners of both shops are siblings. Highly recommend trying them. Everyone has their own tastes, and what's delicious to us might not be the same for everyone.🤟🏼😎","I forgot it was Buddha's birthday today. I arrived this morning following the map, only to find the gates closed and seemingly out of luck. Luckily, a few persistent Korean tourists knocked on the door, allowing me to finally enjoy coffee and pizza. Coffee and pizza is a rare breakfast combination for me, but it felt perfectly natural here. I hadn't realized the items were from two different shops. Perhaps the owners are used to this kind of ordering, so they've quickly gotten their food ready. They have several coffee beans to choose from, and the thin, crispy pizza is delicious and highly recommended. The two owners were incredibly welcoming; if it weren't for their willingness to work overtime, today's breakfast wouldn't have been possible. Thank you so much!"

The iced Espresso i got was an iced latte, I asked why i have milk inside my drink and they told me that I should have ordered an iced Americano and not an espresso because the iced espresso is actually an iced latte.

Firstly, the 4 stars is all on atmosphere.  Our kids had a fantastic time interacting with the walls.  They drew pictures which were then scanned up into the projections.  Really fun and rewarding.

Look at the pictures and you will see that the dining experience would be also a great place for romance... at the other end of the room.  Or, the place would be a sensational venue for a special group event if you booked it out entirely.

Some unwarranted criticism in other reviews - you don't need to walk through rubbish or a warehouse.  The restaurant is easy to find.  Go up the stairs and look for the signs - or simply turn right (ser the video).

Warranted comments in other reviews.  The service - yes, the stagg are unfriendly.  They are abrupt and generally just take your order with a forced smile.  There are too many of them, so perhaps they like leaving the work to their colleagues.  I don't know... but it needs fixing to match the experience factor.

The food - the Brazilian styke BBQ was great.  It was tge only dish that truly matched the ambience.  The rest were ordinary - but the portions were good, so I think the pricing is about right.

A few minor things.  There are power cords across the floor.  I almost tripped on one.  They need to be properly secured.

The table positioning means.that some seats are in direct line with the projectors.  I sat with lights in my eyes and couldn't see the people sitting opposite.  Simply putting the edge tables on angles would fix this issue.  Otherwise, take a table in the middle of the room.

The food mostly came out together - so that previously mentioned issue seems to have been fixed.  Although, there was a small gap as only one waiter served us despite there being many staff on hand.

So come here for the experience and enjoy the food.  You will have a good night out.","If you want to go to those super fancy hologram rooms, but you don’t have enough money to pay for it, This is a place to go! The food is priced reasonably well for the room that you sent in. I recommend getting the salmon as it is very crispy and peppery . But I don’t recommend getting the floating barbecue because the pork is very chewy but other than that I’ve definitely recommend going to this place because of it’s holograms and style. I recommend going with you and one other person.","Overall, it was a good experience. However, the staff could benefit from some additional service training. For example, when we ordered a bottle of wine, the server poured it directly into the glasses without first asking our preference or offering to serve each guest individually. Additionally, with four dishes on a small table for two, it would have been helpful if the staff checked in to clear empty plates as we went along. Small improvements in attentiveness would make the dining experience even better.",What an amazing experience! Had a group birthday dinner and it was a magical time. All those projectors set up were very impressive and created a 180 immersion. Drinks were fantastic! Best cocktails I’ve had in Chiang Mai. Definitely a cool place to come with friends for a celebration.,This place is a gem you might not find unless you were looking for it. The food was good-- one of the best takes on khao soi pizza I've had so far. But the atmosphere of the seperate dining spaces is the real draw. It was fun and whimsical.

It also serves as a co-working space, offering both indoor and outdoor seating. The restroom is clean, which is always a plus.

And Mod and the owner are so kind.,"Tucked away in the far back of a Soi, you can find Tora the tiger 🐅. He doesn't look too impressed with tourist photos but his owner makes some great Coconut Water Americano. The Orange Americano was really nice as well thanks to the fresh orange juice.

We also had a Banoffee cake which was very tasty. It has a biscuit base that tastes similar to Oreos, a thick layer of bananas and it's covered in cream. I generally do not like Banoffee cake but I have to admit this was great 👍

If you're in the area and up for an adventure down the Soi, pay Tora Bake a visit. You'll walk through some traditional Thai living quarters and be able to see the local way of life."

Since I am plant-based/vegan/organic lifestyle, I love to visit and support local organic health stores.

I found elephant organic health foods shop just  by searching organic on Google maps, and this rare gem store popped up as I’m so thankful and blessed to have found this wonderful place.

For those who are health conscious, looking for organic Superfoods/powders/protein powder/grains, essential oils, delicious smoothies, and other health products, this is the place to stop in and shop. They have a little bit of everything in case you’re traveling abroad and worried about not having certain items with you to satisfy your health needs.

They have their own brand/ products of organic superfood powders and more to satisfy all of your health needs.

I started out shopping for a vegan floss which I found and I love, then I saw a gentleman walked in and ordered a smoothie which I didn’t realize until I saw the menu later. So I decided to order the super green smoothie and it was delicious especially if you enjoy your greens, well balanced flavor with the fruits and their in-store brand super green organic powder.

I love how they utilize their own products in their smoothies, a great way to sample their powders so if you plan to make your own smoothies at home , you can buy the powder there and enjoy at home or wherever you’re staying so you can make your own smoothies.

You can also order their products and have them shipped if you plan to stay in Thailand for sometime

I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner  Sasa who is very friendly, cool, and fun to talk with especially aboutHealth/travel/life /and more. Sasa is very knowledgeable about Health foods/and more to help accommodate your daily needs to optimize nutrition and overall to maintain a healthy body.

I ended up staying in the shop for almost 2 hours, just hanging out having a great conversation with the owner and other team members, shopping around, testing out products, and also ordering a second smoothie which was the berry boost, another delicious smoothie on the menu as I look forward to trying more before I leave.

So I ended up buying a few smoothies, some super green powder, mosquito repellent, vegan floss, and Sasa’s Bonita essential oil made by the owner.

Overall, this is a beautiful establishment as I am blessed to have found Elephant Organic (Health Foods). Be sure to stop in and try a smoothie and test out some of their products and enjoy a great experience. 😃🙏🏼🌱💚🫐🥭🥥🥬🇹🇭"

With its vintage and hipster decor, stepping inside feels like entering a warm, inviting home. The ambiance is relaxing with nice music in the background, although the lighting leans a bit too warm for our taste.

The seating is well thought out, with options for both work and chilling. We enjoyed their light and medium roast iced lattes, both of which were made well. They also have a good selection of non-caffeinated drinks, making it a great choice for everyone. They also have non-dairy milk options with additional 20 Bahts. The drinks are priced between 60-85 Bahts which is not bad for the air conditioned cafe.

On a second visit, we tried the Thai iced tea, but it was a bit too creamy for our liking, despite its popularity. The butter cake was tasty but on the small side for the price.

I recently stayed at Cmor Hotel Chiang Mai and had a truly enjoyable experience. The hotel is modern, clean, and located in a quiet yet convenient area near Nimmanhaemin Road — one of the trendiest parts of Chiang Mai.

The room was spacious, well-designed, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. I especially appreciated the comfortable bed and the strong Wi-Fi, which made it easy to work and relax.

What really stood out, however, was the staff. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping was incredibly friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and were always happy to offer recommendations for local attractions and food spots.

The pool area is small but cozy, perfect for a quick dip after a day of exploring. The breakfast buffet was fresh and had a good variety of both local and international options.

Cons: On a flight path - if you want a peaceful night sleep this is not for you, unless you're a very very deep sleeper.
The ladies on reception were not very friendly and seemed as if we were an inconvenience and that they would rather be somewhere else.
Breakfast not smooth - omelette stand never operated, and i had to turn on the waffle machine as noone could work out why it wasn't doing anything.
Pool on first floor, in the shade.","Great location with convenient transportation. The accommodation is excellent—very clean, with a swimming pool and well-appointed rooms.

I especially want to thank a staff member named Puupay. Late one night, when I needed help, she went out of her way to assist me with so much care and discretion. Even though it wasn’t something the hotel normally provides, she personally helped me and made sure I felt comfortable and not embarrassed at all. Her thoughtfulness and warmth genuinely touched me.🥰😊🙏🙏

Because of people like Puupay, this hotel feels more than just a place to stay🥰🥰 it feels like a place where guests are truly cared for.

We tried the rose tea – it was fragrant and had a strong tea aroma – and the hot latte was smooth and delicious.

Regarding the tea roasting section, we recommend trying it yourself. If you like it, you can buy some to take home. If you're planning to open a tea shop, you can come and try the teas and get advice. They even have tea menus available. They roast and wholesale tea leaves, and have many different types and blends of tea.

Tucked away roadside, this new gem has just 3 camp tables outside + 1 indoor seat — cozy and unassuming.

Coffee Experience
Ordered their dark roast Americano (single-origin beans from Chiang Rai, Thailand). The rich crema blew me away — as a coffee geek, I’d rank it equally with Sumatra Mandheling! Bold smoky notes layered with subtle peaty earthiness and a cocoa finish. Masterful extraction too.

Price Point
Just ฿45 for that stellar Americano (all drinks ฿35-50). Unbeatable value!

Verdict
📍 Dark roast devotees — this is your sanctuary.","Lovely little spot to pick up a coffee - standard iced Black Americano for me, 40 baht.

The atmosphere was incredibly quiet, warm, and peaceful. I was deeply impressed by the coffee expert who looked like a grandfather—or perhaps a father—and by the kind service of his grandson, or maybe his son. My heart felt warm because of them.

On my last day, I said goodbye and told them I hoped we’d meet again next year.
I visit Chiang Mai every year, so it felt a little sad that I only discovered this place now.
At the end of 2026, I’ll go there every day :)
Until then, I wish you good health and happiness.","This place has become very popular over the last few years, especially if you live around Santitham.
It’s honestly the best coffee ever... made with so much love and it costs only 40 baht.
I always love to support small family business and they are the sweetest.
the son and his dad work together and brew the best coffe, I really like them.
It's always a pleasure to enjoy my morning coffee here. It has such a cute surrounding with the small plants in the sitting area.

Since it became more popular, the waiting time can be a little longer, but that’s because everyone wants good coffee for 40 baht.","We stopped by 2 days we were in Chiang Mai, and on Christmas day we got takeaways (where they gave us Dunkin Donuts free with our coffee 🥲)
They’re so kind and generous, it cost us 70baht (Aus$3.50) for 2 coffees, mine with almond milk (milk lab too) which is crazy, they could easily charge double, & the coffee is good quality. They provide free water & wifi, and kindly refused when i tried to leave them a tip.
The bathroom for the cafe is in their house which they kindly let me use.

If you are in the area definitely check them out, they deserve all the business they can get & they make incredible coffees.

thank you so much ☺️","Excellent coffee, good price! The owner is very kind, and the service is thoughtful, they provide mosquitoes spray on every table.

This cozy spot attracts many regular Western customers, some even bringing their own breakfast to pair with the coffee. The latte here has a rich, full-bodied flavor with low acidity, which makes it one of my personal favorites in town.

The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the menu is affordable with plenty of variety, making it a great choice for a relaxed and satisfying start to the day.","Absolutely 5 stars. A magic cafe that brews both good coffee and Thai tea. Once you drink their ice latte and fresh orange americano, you will understand why they have queues everyday in the shop. Drinks are cheap, around 40/50 baht per cup. The owner grows his own bean proudly. I think they are a family small business. Do order their ice latte, it’s strong nutty flavored coffee with special chocolate aroma. Most importantly, try their Thai tea, both black and green are super good. Their tea is way better than Chatramue with same price. I guess their secret is to boil the tea with moka pot. Fantastic flavor! My top 5 cafe in Chiangmai.","This neighborhood cafe seems to have a devoted crowd of regulars and I can understand why. Good relaxing vibes, super friendly barista and his partner who seem dedicated to their craft. Very good coffee at one of the lowest prices around.  What's not to like?","Great coffee, friendly owner, really good music playlist are top 3 elements of a truly great coffee shop. Thai tea coffee mix latte made in a Moka pot has gotta be one of the best taste sensations of the year!  'Hot water and coffee gives bright eyes' is a loose translation of Thai name 'ต้ม ต๋ม จื้น'","Tried so many coffee and Thai tea in chiang mai. This is the best. The coffee is delicious and made with such care and love. The thai tea is brewed in a mocha pot, it gives it a special kick of freshness and taste.

The smoothies, the coconut, the orange coffee - everything in this shop is so fresh, and you can feel it when you drink.

+ they have a large bar sitting, it functions as a real social hub of santitham.
Costumers are a mix of locals and foreigners with a good palette for coffee.

It does draw a rotating crowd akin to its size throughout a weekday afternoon, though a table or two was always available when I visited.

WC—outside; facing the shop's facade from the street, go down the entryway to the left, walk all the way down till you see a WC sign on the wall, where you'll be prompted to turn right into the corridor at the far end; it'll be the last door down that corridor. There's a sink right by the initial entryway one can use.","I love this coffee shop! The coconut coffee latte is the best I've had. The shop is small but the interior is very tastefull and well picked. You can tell the owner has a an eye for the beautiful. The music is also chill to work to and not your regular radio pop (except during Christmas to be fair). The owner might seem short of polite phrases but is actually very nice. One time I lost my wallet and didn't know where I left it and he not only checked the shop but also checked the cctv for me. Also very reasonable priced, just an overall 10/10 for me.","It’s a very nice little shop and the staff was very nice and welcoming.

If you order a coffee and charge your MacBook there, they would charge 100 baht per hour. (coffee is around 70 baht, tasteful).

I asked if the charging fee could be cheaper (already I showed intent for paying 'electricity fee'), and the manager got annoyed in 2 minutes and forbade me to enter.

Ok, so I went to another café, and just wrote an honest review.","Great comfortable place to get some work done and drink great coffee.  There’s a nice padded leather bench seat that extends one length of the place that’s really nice to sit on.

However, during my visit on February 10, 2026, the staff member on duty appeared quite tired and slightly tense, which affected the overall experience for customers to some extent. It even made me hesitate to order an additional drink, despite the menu being very appealing. My friends who were with me noticed the same thing.

Having additional staff during busy periods might help the service run more smoothly, as the café is clearly very popular. Every time I visit Chiang Mai, I bring friends here and always recommend this place to other international friends as well.

On a previous visit, I was served by a male staff member who handled a very busy and noisy situation with great professionalism. He was polite, attentive, and considerate. My friends were very impressed, and one of them translated for me when he apologized to customers for the noise that day (the café was extremely crowded). I could tell he was tired and working alone, and although he seemed a bit stressed, he still did his best to smile and provide excellent service to everyone.

Overall, this is a lovely café, and I sincerely hope to have an even better experience on my next visit.","Nice cafe in heart of the market.

ChIJS2ofWO472jAR8ETdHlMizqo,Hello māo café,18.8066977,98.95766979999999,4.5,64,2025-08-22,"Friendly, helpful staff and the cats behave well and are lovely. However, the cats were not well groomed (the fur had not been brushed) and many of them were sick with runny noses. However, I cannot know whether the cats receive medicine and are groomed later so I will still give a fair review of 3 stars. I just hope the staff finds the time to take a bit more care of the cats or, maybe give the customers brushes so they can do the grooming instead?","I had a great time at the cat café! The cats are super cute, playful, and full of energy. They all look very happy and well cared for. It was a lovely experience, I’d love to visit again!","Guys, please help the cats get better - some of them are really sick. Some have runny noses and itchy eyes.

People here have written that the cats are skinny, but I think they look that way because many of them are still teenagers and therefore appear very thin. They have free access to food.

The cat room smells terrible. When you keep multiple animals in the same room, you need to keep it clean. My feet were sticking to the floor, and I'm guessing it's because of the urine that can remain on the cats' paws. You need to wash the floors several times a day and change the litter in their litter box more often. The smell is truly terrible. For comparison, you can go to a similar place in Niman. It's spotlessly clean and there's no smell.

And of course, it's worth mentioning that some of the cats are very dirty. Because they have long hair, some of them have fecal matter under their tails. I feel so sorry for the animals that the staff and owner don't care about them.

In our parish, one of the employees was studying English with a tutor while working. It would be better if you brushed one of the cats or washed them:/","Cozy cafe with delicious drink options. The orange americano and caramel macchiato tastes good. The kittens are very interactive. Got house rules before playing with cats (such as wearing socks). If you are not wearing socks, can buy a pair for 10 baht.","I found this café accidentally while walking around and I feel so lucky that I did. It's an amazing place with plenty of wonderful, cute and beautiful, unique cats! Maine coons, Persian, Munchkins and others, kittens, adults. All the cats were very playful, friendly and healthy.
The staff members are extremely polite, kind and helpful. They are hardworking and keep the place and litter boxes very clean.
All visitors should wear a pair of socks when entering the cat interaction room, and also mandatory to disinfect your hands.
It's possible to visit the cats only and you can also have drinks (coffee, tea, soft drinks)

I had an amazing time there and recommend it to everyone who loves cats."
ChIJf2ekfbE72jARYMj6ytQjmJw,RotSomJai (Kin Sa Bo),18.8092681,98.9531245,4.7,65,2022-04-05,"Rossomjai Coffee has strategically relocated from a local community setting to a more prominent position near the main road leading to Doi Suthep, a move that is expected to enhance its visibility and accessibility. While the flavor profile of the coffee did not align with my personal preferences, it is important to acknowledge that taste is subjective, and other patrons may find it quite appealing.

Upon attempting to connect to the internet, I noted that the restaurant's Wi-Fi network was detectable. However, there was no visible display of the Wi-Fi password within the establishment. As a guest, I felt a degree of discomfort in approaching the staff to request the password, particularly as they appeared to be fully engaged with their duties at the bar. I suggest that prominently displaying Wi-Fi credentials, perhaps on tables, could significantly improve customer convenience and encourage a more seamless online experience.

Furthermore, I recommend a review of the current table arrangements. My seating position, directly facing the bar, exposed me to a somewhat cluttered area, which could detract from the overall ambiance. Optimizing the layout could enhance the dining experience for guests.

In terms of pricing, the cost of items was acceptable, though it was comparatively higher than some local competitors who offer what I perceive as a more comprehensive experience.","A tiny cafe with good drinks. The thing here is they will adjust your drink how you want it and it is super flexible as you can see in the picture. The space is tiny, so it is better for many to just to get a take away.",Their entrance shows pour over coffee.. but they don’t have pour over coffee…,Thai milk tea can be adjusted with the sugar levels and how strong tea flavour you want.,"Delicious! I don’t like overly sweet drinks so I love how customizable these drinks are. You can get 0, 10, 25, 50% sweet as well as adjust for how strong of tea flavor you want.

There are five CRTs with retro consoles where I spent my time. Everything is well set up, cleaned and maintained. You can play almost all retro games you wish. There are also five flat screens with PS5s and Switches. For the retro consoles you buy a drink and can use them, for the modern consoles its 50 THB per hour, which I think is very fair. Highly recommend this place, loved it!","This cafe bring me further than just playing ps5 but with some of retro consoles I never heared of them even I am the big fan of gaming console

you can order cafe or lots of drink and enjoy many types of game including lots of mainstram games in both single player & multi players like Black myth wukong , Elden ring , Ghost of yotei , tekken 8 , street fighter 6 or even party animals and smash bow in Nintendo you named it.

ChIJnf-YFAA72jAREx1fcZKTlqI,CuppaCharm Coffee,18.808978,98.9545313,4.8,27,2025-02-15,"I visited this café two times, and I had a great experience. The place is clean, with relaxing jazz music playing in the background. The drinks are reasonably priced, with a variety of options, including coffee, tea, and soda. You can also customize the sweetness level and add extras like honey if you prefer. They also offer free Wi-Fi and charging spots, which is super convenient.

I had a chat with the owner, who was incredibly friendly. They mentioned that the café opened just a few months ago and that they’re planning to introduce a new menu soon. On my first visit, I ordered a Cocoa Latte with regular sweetness. It was delicious! The owner also gave me a banana cake with caramel to try for free, saying they were still perfecting the recipe. It was fantastic!

The next day, I decided to visit again in the late evening and stayed until the place was about to close. One of the owners remembered me and asked if I wanted to try an unreleased drink, a strawberry latte. The day before, I had asked if they had any fruity drinks besides peach since I’m not a big fan of peach, and they told me the strawberry latte would be available the next day. So, of course, I came back.

The drink was great, but at first, they gave me a regular straw, which made it a bit difficult to mix the strawberry with the milk and drink it properly. When the owner asked for my feedback, I mentioned that the straw wasn’t strong enough for mixing and wasn’t wide enough for the strawberry pulp to pass through. She immediately apologized and brought me a larger straw, the kind used for bubble tea. On top of that, she gave me another banana cake on the house.

I’ll definitely be back if I visit this city again!","The café is nice. Cakes are delicious. However, I ordered a cup of filtered coffee (because I saw beautiful v60 gears at the bar), and it's not good. It seems they don't have a clue how to make filter coffee but still sell it 😅.","I’m pretty sure we were given 2 cups of milk when we ordered two hot cappuccinos… at least say that you don’t know how to make a drink, but to wait quite a while for that.. just kind of unprofessional. Wanted to give a good review but just being honest about our experience.","Comfortable cafe. Good to sit and chill, or do some work 😌","Located at the entrance of an alley near the university, this coffeeshop will become one of my favorites in Chiang Mai. It has been open for a month by Golf and Sophia, a friendly young Thai couple who are smiling and who will give you a warm welcome. They have concocted different homemade blends of organic coffees from plantations in the Chiang Dao district, north of Chiang Mai. Whether you like a smooth or strong coffee, there will be one to suit your taste. Unless you prefer an excellent green tea or a delicious strawberry milk! The space is bright with a high ceiling. The polished concrete floor and vintage furniture elements contribute to the relaxed atmosphere. This coffeeshop stands out for another significant aspect. Golf and Sophia are lovers of good music and they have equipped their shop with high-end audio equipment. A delicious coffee or tea while listening to good songs and sound in a warm and smiling atmosphere, all this at very reasonable prices... what else?"

I came here because I wasn't feeling well. The food was expensive, and the panna cotta was terrible. The panna cotta was bland and hard. The sauce was too sweet, lacking strawberry flavor, and was all pink. It made my throat hurt, and I felt sick.

The staff and chef didn't know the order of serving. They brought the main course first, and the salad came last. It made me unable to eat the salad.

The sashimi rice bowl was apparently ordered for children. The staff didn't care about the kitchen, so they put wasabi on the plate. This carelessness was so obvious.

Her smile is infectious, and her easygoing nature makes you feel like you've known her for years.

This time, I ordered drinks through the Foodpanda app and was extremely impressed with the speed of delivery and, most importantly, the generous discounts. It was even better value than I expected. I ordered the Iced Cocoa and Iced Matcha Latte. The flavors were rich, just the right amount of sweet, and not at all cloying. The cocoa had a distinct aroma, while the matcha gave a refreshing, Japanese-inspired feel. I didn't want to put my cup down. The packaging was cute and the attention to detail was excellent. Even with delivery, the quality remained excellent.

If you're in Chiang Mai or looking for a cafe with great drinks, excellent service, and reasonable prices, Chubboy Cafe is a must-try. You won't be disappointed. Especially if you find a discount code on Foodpanda, it will be even more worth it.

Okay so I ordered from Chubboy Cafe on Foodpanda the other day and damn, it was way better than I expected. Got a crazy good discount, like almost half-off kind of deal. I got an iced cocoa and iced matcha—both were bomb. The cocoa was super rich and smooth, not too sweet. And the matcha? Bro, it tasted like a straight-up Tokyo café moment. So good.

Even the packaging was cute, like they actually put effort into it even though it was just delivery. If you’re in Chiang Mai and craving something cold and tasty without breaking the bank, def check out Chubboy. And if you catch a discount on Foodpanda? Say less. Worth it 100%."

There are plenty of parking spaces available. The drinks are delicious with reasonable prices, but a little disappointment is they can’t deliver your drink order to your table which is a minus point for me because usually I can order up to 2 drinks after I finished with the first one.","The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent, with multiple zones to choose from. The outdoor zone offers a river view and great fresh air. The indoor area is comfortably air-conditioned. The restaurant provides different moods in one place, with plenty of parking available.

The barista, with extensive latte competition experience, delivers exceptional latte art.

Creative coffee options, especially the peanut-infused one, are a must-try. Highly recommended!","This review is strictly for the cafe itself, not the pool/onsen.

Forget about going here to work. Probably not even to hang out and chill. Plenty of other places for that. It's clearly not the place for either.
I don't think it even knows what it wants to be. It's really dark and loud, in stark contrast to the entire property around it. Plus it doesn't serve food!

This cafe really should be redesigned to complement the pool/ ""onsen"" business.

The chairs are super uncomfortable, and the tables are tiny.
The music was very loud too, and the Cafe had most of its blinds down so they can play some really out of place cartoon projected onto the wall. No idea what they are thinking.

I got the ""energy"" smoothie which was absolutely terrible. It was really small for the price (120, +20 for almond milk,) and it came out as a thick slush that you need a spoon for (which they didn't give). It tasted like a bag of cacao blended with a couple ice cubes. Pretty gross and not what was expected.

Hard pass on this place. Wifi was good and nice view of the pool though.","Good decoration and vibe but not a place to work because loud music (good for chilling) and uncomfortable chair. Btw, the coffee is not good as expected (by this price) and the staff is really not warm welcome … maybe she had a bad morning before going to work at the café. I really have no idea that it is not allow to wait outside before 10am. (bad air pollution then need to find some free space to sit and wait). Once the staff arrived and saw me sitting on the 2nd floor, she was frustrated and spoke to me with negative attitude like I would steal or break sth. by just sitting in front of the cafe… but honestly no sign at the G floor not to go upstair before 10am…who is gonna know? Better sit by the pool if the weather is nice. 😢",Excellent cafe. I am the first one to review. It is amazing. Great pool next to it. I will come back!! Thank you.

The coffee is exceptional, and the atmosphere is incredibly serene and relaxing. However, I have a minor complaint about the food menu.

Additionally, some music would enhance the overall experience.
Overall, solid place to grab some coffee and enjoy the natural surroundings.","Lovely café with a beautiful natural atmosphere and plenty of cozy seating areas.

Coffee or Me is a charming café nestled within a hotel, which I happened upon by chance while driving through the area. It’s an ideal spot for those seeking a quiet, nature-filled retreat to work or unwind, offering a refreshing contrast to the bustling cafés in downtown Chiang Mai. With its lush greenery and serene atmosphere, the setting is undeniably inviting.

However, when it comes to the coffee, I found it somewhat underwhelming—perhaps because the café prioritizes ambiance over the quality of its brews. Additionally, the service felt a bit distant, which slightly detracted from the overall experience. A more attentive approach to customer service could enhance both the atmosphere and the coffee itself, making this hidden gem even more enjoyable.","A great find.   'Coffee or Me' is a coffee house about half an hour's drive northwest from Chiang Mai Central in a quiet area with lovely gardens.

From 2:00 to 4:00 on Sunday we had a jazz duo playing very good music,  otherwise it's a lovely quiet atmosphere there.

I had a panini sandwich which was excellent and the coffee, hot or cold, was equally good.

A little bit more expensive than other places but well worth it.   Highly recommended.","Good coffee, delicious cheesecake, good seats for working on your laptop or studying.
Weekends are crowded but that’s not a surprise.

Aircon is too cold in some seats. The ice cold air is blasting you right in the face. Be careful where you sit"

Coffee is nice, pricey. But you pay for the atmosphere. Enjoy ☺️","A Beautiful, Pet-Friendly Café in Chiang Mai With Amazing Matcha & Fresh Pastries

Dorle Coffee Shop in Chiang Mai is truly one of the most charming and peaceful cafés in the city. If you’re searching for a relaxing spot with great drinks, delicious pastries, and a pet-friendly environment, this place is a must-visit.

One of the highlights is their pure matcha (clear matcha) — it’s absolutely spot on. Smooth, refreshing, and perfectly balanced, it’s one of the best matcha drinks you can find in Chiang Mai. They also offer a delightful selection of freshly baked pastries, all of which are incredibly yummy. Whether you love buttery croissants or other treats, everything tastes freshly made. They even have sourdough, which is a big plus for bread lovers.

Dorle is also wonderfully pet friendly. Dogs are welcome inside the air-conditioned area as long as they don’t disturb other customers, making it an ideal café for hot Chiang Mai days. Their outdoor garden is another highlight—lush, beautifully manicured, and truly zen, perfect for relaxing with your drink or spending quiet time with your furry friend.

The staff are lovely, polite, and genuinely friendly, adding to the overall warm and welcoming atmosphere.

If you’re looking for a pet-friendly café in Chiang Mai, a spot with excellent matcha, or a garden coffee shop with fresh pastries and sourdough, Dorle Coffee Shop is absolutely worth supporting and visiting. Highly recommended!","I found this place by searching for a new cafe in town. I like its cozy, simple design and great brew. They offer a variety of coffee choices and recommend good ones that suit you. We only tried pretzels with pepper and Choux Cream. I like the soft and tender cream but not into pretzel. The price is reasonable, and the staff is friendly. If you come on the weekend, it might be packed, and some patisseries may be sold out.

Overall I like it and will try more bakeries next time.","I haven’t been to the café in person, but my friend gave me their Amaretti cookies as a gift and they were AMAZING! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, nutty, sweet… Even though I haven’t tried the rest of the menu, the cookies were so good I had to write a review."

I know Baristro serves good coffee, and i know this place is special as next to Ping ricer.

The menu are the same as rest of Baristro.

But the venue is nicely built, not as brutalist as the one at train station. But it has such a cozy feeling to it.

Well designed seats and space.

And sitting facing the river can spend a whole afternoon without much problem.

I often wonder what is it to see, it’s just a muddy river.

But wait, it sort of gives me this calm. The sky is clear bright, the river is flowing slowly, and quiet. And across the river are some green trees.

Occasionally i see tour boat passing, but they are muted and absorb unto the view.

I ordered the Nutella latte, expecting a standard drink, but I was completely blown away after the first sip. The combination of Nutella and coffee is incredibly delicious and satisfying—definitely one of the best surprises I've had.

Without a doubt, this has become one of my favorite spots in Chiang Mai!","Very spacious cafe along the Ping River.

The best place indeed. You can feel that the owner created it more for children to enjoy and for parents to feel comfortable rather than for business profit. For a father like me, who has to take care of a child all day, it has been the perfect place. If you can show a Thai driver’s license, or if your child studying in Thailand can show a student ID, you get a 50% discount on the entrance fee.","Hidden Village Chiang Mai: A Must-Visit for Families and Fun Photo Ops!
""If you're looking for a fun, action-packed destination just outside the main city, Hidden Village is the perfect choice, especially if you have children! This venue successfully combines several unique attractions into one engaging space.
Key Highlights & Experience:
The most impressive feature is definitely the Dinosaur Village. The life-sized models—some of which move and roar—provide a genuinely exciting and slightly educational experience for kids. Beyond the prehistoric giants, the venue offers a Pet Village where children can interact with friendly animals, and fun zones like the Giant Insects section, which is fantastic for unique, Instagram-worthy photos.
Atmosphere & Facilities:
It's a large, well-maintained area that gives the feel of an exploratory, whimsical park. There are plenty of activities and play areas to keep younger visitors entertained for hours. Facilities, including dining options like The Barn Steak House, are available on site, making it easy to spend a half or full day here.
Expert Tip:
While it caters primarily to families, the fun and quirky themed zones offer excellent backdrop material for anyone looking for creative photos. Highly recommend for families visiting Chiang Mai looking for an easy, guaranteed day of fun!""","For the price and the experience, this is easily a 5-star attraction for younger children. It features a charming, simple play area and small animals that you can feed for a small fee. The grounds are spacious and fantastic for kids to explore. I highly recommend The Hidden Village in Chiang Mai to any families with little ones who have the time to visit.","Do you really think this place is expensive? This is not a hotel playground. The grounds are very spacious and constantly being cleaned. Although it’s not the newest facility, there are many hidden things that children would enjoy. The animals were also living quite comfortably, and the place felt clean for us as well. However, it’s more suitable for toddlers than older children, and it’s a good idea to bring a hat. I would recommend not going if it rained the day before.","We arrived at 10am in January. The weather was perfect. Cool and bright. It had rides, animals to feed, horses to ride, playgrounds, and Dinosaur land. It was  THB250 per pax."

It has changed hands recently, the tables are in disrepair, and the chairs are 80% broken.

There is no table service, which is fine, but nobody will tell you this.

There should be a process where you choose your meat on a stick selection, be given a tally of your choices, so there is no confusion when you go to pay.
This seems logical to me, yet twice since the new people have taken over, my bill has been almost doubled.

It is a real shame, as the right people managing this place could really make it work.

I recognized the shop as one I'd eaten at before and tried to buy something, but the seller was talking while looking down and typing or pressing something on their phone. They then looked up and said, ""There's a very long queue right now, about 10 cups,"" and then went back to what they were doing, leaving me standing there confused without taking my order. I asked, ""So, you're not selling?"" but received no answer. The person next to them just smirked and left without asking if I wanted to wait since there were so many orders. If they had asked, I would have gladly waited. Personally, I felt like they didn't want to sell, so I just walked out. Please improve your service. I didn't make a purchase this time.
