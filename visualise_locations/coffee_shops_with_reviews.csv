The price is at the higher side according to the locals but their traditional desserts defo got me addicted. I wish I could try a few more. Gonna come back again despite the not so good service,"If you're looking for an authentic and charming café experience in the Pa Daet area, Jan Fong (จันฟอง) is an absolute must-visit! This lovely spot specializes in traditional Thai desserts, and every bite is a testament to their dedication to authentic flavors and beautiful presentation","Service is horrible. I arrived at a time when 2-3 staffs were busy at the back of the counter packing, but even if busy you should acknowledge and let the customer know to wait. Only when I tried to ask where to order, did they tell me to wait with an annoyed look. Very bad hospitality all around, no smiles or thank yous at any point.",The atmosphere is great with the nice traditional sweet.,"Anyone who doesn't like Thai desserts should try this shop and they'll change their mind. They're incredibly delicious, with a wonderful aroma of coconut milk and palm sugar. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced. The salted rice cakes, sugarcane syrup cakes, steamed rice cakes, and dog's tongue cakes – everything we ordered was delicious. It was a truly amazing experience. The shop is cute, comfortable, and has parking in front. I highly recommend trying it."

The food menu is limited to a handful of well prepared meals - I had chicken with chilli and Thai basil - delicious.
The iced chocolate is delicious, and tastes of real chocolate. Located in a townhouse complex it's a hidden gem and worth the effort to find.","The bigger original chain at Old City is closed (those that u saw in the pics). We dined at the smaller but charming outlet. Spend a total of 500THB and was given a complimentary tasting of the freshly hand poured single origin coffee beans from Nan. Lovely service staff. Bright & cheerful!

Try the ice cream with mung bean topping.","Delicious, cozy, friendly. A wonderful place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They have a really nice menu and I highly recommend getting the Thai classics, spice is Thai level. The coffee here is phenomenal and well made, with an option for your preferred roast level. The staff is super nice helpful, one of them has great English. Highly recommend this place, prices are OK. Hours SSMTTF 08:30-21:00.",Lovely place for breakfast and coffee. We went there just by chance and it turned out to be one of the best breakfast we had in Thai. Very reasonable prices and friendly staff. Their coffee is very good actually. Many cute local crafts and herbs related products. We really enjoyed our time here. A great start for our day in Chiangmai.,I loved the seating arrangement that were offered. I felt like I was really experiencing the Thai lifestyle. The food on offer was excellent and my wife and I really enjoyed trying new things out that we would rarely try.

Back in March-April 2025, we were very impressed with the flavor of their chocolate-infused bean. It was great!

Now, however, something has gone wrong with roasting process. The chocolate flavor is gone even though it's still marketed as such.

Without this additive flavor, their beans are average at best.","this clean, lrage-feeling shop primarily sells coffee machines  (and some coffees) , including high-end ones, some look quite commercial; if you need the best you should look here;
they provide coffee on-site but that is more a favor in order to sell their on-site raw coffees; it is not meant to be a coffee shop or cafe, no food, friendly staff; iffy parking, is located in K-Park, turn left at KFC Mahidol",Not meant to be a coffee shop but they have dam good coffee!  Excellent atmosphere and staff! If you are nearby stop and enjoy. Very high end/quality machines for sale as well ☺️,"They sell great coffee and tea supplies, staff is always friendly and they provide samples.

It is always a bliss to stop by and buy some coffee here.","They sell the best coffee in Chiang Mai, it's not a coffee shop, they sell coffee and coffee machines and accessories."

i found the staff a bit brusque; we went twice , consecutive days only because we had to wait for a clinic in that k-park area to open and there is very little quality coffee competition in that walking-distance area; KFC is jsut a few meters away; so-so parking; some outside seating but i cant imagine why given the huge road noise outside there",Roastinyom is a brand I can trust.  The coffee is always tasty.  There are 2 baristas working at this location providing good fast service.  There are enough chairs and seats for more than 40 people here.   The upstairs is a quiet area that can accommodate about 20 people.,Good Taste.,😴😴😴😴,"This branch of Rosniyom features a spacious, airy, minimalist design with outdoor seating. The second floor houses a meeting room. The drinks maintain the signature Rosniyom standard. There's parking for three cars in front of the shop, but additional parking is available within the complex."

looks closed permanently to me","A small shop on Mahidol Road, located within the K-Park Business Center. Coffee is their main menu item and tastes good ☕️. They also have a decent selection of à la carte dishes. I already mentioned to the owner that the vegetables weren't cooked thoroughly, and I hope this helps them improve the taste even more 🧆. It would add another great place for us to chill 🧜‍♀️. Parking isn't too difficult 🚖.",,,
